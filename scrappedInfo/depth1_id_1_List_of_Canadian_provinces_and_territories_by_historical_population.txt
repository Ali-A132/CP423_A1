This is a
list of Canadian historical population by province and territory
, drawn from the
Canadian census of population
data and pre-Confederation censuses of Newfoundland and Labrador. Since 1871, Canada has conducted regular national census counts. The data for 1851 to 1976 is drawn primarily from
Historical Statistics of Canada
, 2nd edition.

Data for 1981 through 2021 are from the respective year's respective census. Newfoundland and Labrador pre-Confederation data is from the 1945
Census of Newfoundland and Labrador
, volume 1.

Data for 1841 and some 1851 data drawn from the
1931 Canadian census

With the exception of
Nunavut
prior to 1996, the population figures largely reflect modern provincial boundaries; prior to 1996, the population of modern Nunavut is reported with
Northwest Territories
. Although the census has worked to count
First Nations
populations since 1871, the it is likely
Indigenous Canadians
are undercounted by the census.

Shaded blocks indicate periods before the province or territory joined the Canadian Confederation. Instances where the reported figure came from a different year's population count (primarily pre-1861 and for Newfoundland) are noted. Total Canadian population row includes the population of Newfoundland and Labrador.
