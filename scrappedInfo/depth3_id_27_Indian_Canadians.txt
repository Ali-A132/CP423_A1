Indian Canadians
are
Canadians
who have ancestry from
India
. The term
East Indian
is sometimes used to avoid confusion with
Indigenous groups
. Categorically, Indian Canadians comprise a subgroup of
South Asian Canadians
which is a further subgroup of
Asian Canadians
. As of the
2021 census
,
Indians
are the largest non-European ethnic group in the country and form the fastest growing national origin in Canada.

Canada contains the world's seventh-largest
Indian diaspora
. The highest concentrations of Indian Canadians are found in
Ontario
and
British Columbia
, followed by growing communities in
Alberta
and
Quebec
as well, with the majority of them being foreign-born.

In Canada, '
South Asian
' refers to persons with ancestry throughout
South Asia
, while '
East Indian
' means someone with origins specifically from
India

Originating as a part of the Canadian government's multicultural policies and ideologies in the 1980s, 'Indo-Canadian' is a term used in mainstream circles of people in Canada as of 2004.
[

In 1962, 'Pakistani' and '
Ceylonese
' (Sri Lankan) were made into separate ethnic categories, while prior to that year people with those origins were counted as being 'East Indian'.
[

As of 2001 about half of foreign-born persons claiming an 'East Indian' ancestry originated from India, while others originated from
Bangladesh
,
East Africa
,
Pakistan
, and
Sri Lanka

Elizabeth Kamala Nayar, author of
The Sikh Diaspora in Vancouver: Three Generations Amid Tradition, Modernity, and Multiculturalism

origins.

Kavita A. Sharma, author of
The Ongoing Journey: Indian Migration to Canada
, wrote that she used 'Indo-Canadians' to only refer to those of origins from India who have Canadian citizenship. Otherwise she uses "Indo-Canadian" in an interchangeable manner with 'South Asians' and 'East Indians'.
[

Priya S. Mani, the author of "Methodological Dilemmas Experienced in Researching Indo-Canadian Young Adults’ Decision-Making Process to Study the Sciences," defined "Indo-Canadian" as being children of persons who immigrated from South Asia to Canada.

Despite the diversity in ethnic groups and places of origin among South Asians, previously the term 'South Asian' had been used to be synonymous with 'Indian'.
[
15
]
The Canadian Encyclopedia
stated that the same population has been "referred to as South Asians, Indo-Canadians or East Indians," and that people referred to as 'South Asian' view the term in the way that those from European countries might view the label 'European.'"
[
16
]
According to Nayar, "Many Canadian-born South Asians dislike the term because it differentiates them from other Canadians."
[
10
]
Martha L. Henderson, author of
Geographical Identities of Ethnic America: Race, Space, and Place
, argued that the 'South Asian' term "is meaningful as a defining boundary only in interactions between South Asians and mainstream Canadians."
[
15
]
Henderson added that, because of the conflation of 'South Asian' and 'Indian', "[i]t is very difficult to isolate the history of Asian Indians in Canada from that of other South Asians."

Late 19th century
[
edit
]
The Indo-Canadian community began to form around the late 19th century, pioneered by men, the great majority of whom were
Punjabi
Sikhs
—primarily soldiers of the
Sikh Regiment
and
Punjab Regiment
but also from farming backgrounds—with some
Punjabi Hindus
and
Punjabi Muslims
, and many of whom were
veterans
of the
British Indian Army
.
[
37
]
Canada was part of the
British Empire
, and since India was also under
British rule
, Indians were also
British subjects
. In 1858,
Queen Victoria
had proclaimed that, throughout the Empire, the people of India would enjoy "equal privileges with white people without discrimination of colour,
creed
or race."
[
38
]
The first census which took place following
Canadian Confederation
was in 1871 and enumerated the four original provinces including, Quebec, Ontario, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick found that the population with racial origins from India (then-labeled as
"Hindu"
on the census) stood at 11 persons or 0.0003 percent of the national population, with 8 persons from Ontario, and the remaining 3 persons from Nova Scotia.
[
17
]

In 1897, contingents of Sikh soldiers, from the
Sikh Regiment
and
Punjab Regiment
, participated in the parade to celebrate the
Queen's Diamond Jubilee
in London, England. On their subsequent journey home, they visited the
western coast of Canada
, primarily
British Columbia
, which—because of its very sparse population at the time—the Canadian government wanted to settle in order to prevent a takeover of the territory by the United States.
Punjabi Sikhs in
Vancouver
, 1908
Upon retiring from the army, some soldiers found their pensions to be inadequate, and some also found their land and estates back in India were being utilized by money lenders. Deciding to try their fortunes in the countries they had visited, these men joined an
Indian diaspora
, which included people from
Burma
through
Malaysia
, the
East Indies
, the Philippines, and
China
. The vanguard was able to find work within the police force and some were employed as
night-watchmen
by local firms. Others started small businesses of their own. Such work would provide wages that were very high by Indian standards.
[
39
]
They were guaranteed jobs by agents of large Canadian companies such as the
Canadian Pacific Railway
and the
Hudson's Bay Company
. Having seen Canada for themselves,
Punjabis
sent home letters to their fellow countrymen, recommending them to come to the '
New World
'.
[
39
]
Though initially reluctant to go to these countries due to the treatment of Asians by the white population, many young men chose to go upon the assurance that they would not meet the same fate.
[
38
]
Government quotas were also established to cap the number of Indians allowed to immigrate to Canada in the early 20th century. This was part of a policy adopted by Canada to ensure that the country retained its primarily European demographic, and was similar to
American
and
Australian
immigration policies at the time. These quotas only allowed fewer than 100 people from India a year until 1957, when it was marginally increased (to 300 people a year). In comparison to the quotas established for Indians, Christians from Europe immigrated freely without quotas in large numbers during that time to Canada, numbering in the tens of thousands yearly.

Indians at CPR station in Vancouver,
c.
1914
Throughout history up to the present day, the majority of
South Asian Canadians
have been of Indian origin. Following their brief passage through British Columbia in 1897, Canada had an estimated 100 persons of
Punjabi
Sikh
origin by 1900, concentrated in the western province.
[

Canada's first relatively major wave of South Asian immigration—all men
arrived in Vancouver
in 1903.
[
37
]
These migrants had heard of Canada from Indian troops in Hong Kong, who had travelled through Canada the year prior on their way to celebrate the
coronation of Edward VII
.
[
37
]
Upon arrival to BC, the immigrants faced widespread
racism
by
white Canadians
, most of whom feared that migrant workers would work for less pay and that an influx of immigrants would threaten their jobs. (The same threat was perceived for the
Japanese
and
Chinese
immigrants before them.) As a result, a series of
race riots
targeted the
Indian immigrants
—as well as
other Asian groups
, such as the
Chinese railroad workers
, and
Black Canadians
—who were beaten up by mobs of angry
white Canadians
, though often met with retaliation.

Kitsilano Sikh temple,
c.
1910
A notable moment in early Indo-Canadian history was in 1902 when Punjabi Sikh settlers first arrived in
Golden, British Columbia
to work at the Columbia River Lumber Company.
[
42
]
These early settlers built the first
Gurdwara
(Sikh temple) in Canada and North America in 1905,
[
43
]
[
44
]
which would later be destroyed by fire in 1926.
[
45
]
The second Gurdwara to be built in Canada was in 1908 in
Kitsilano
(
Vancouver
), aimed at serving a growing number of Punjabi Sikh settlers who worked at nearby sawmills along
False Creek
at the time.
[
46
]
The Gurdwara would later close and be demolished in 1970, with the
temple society
relocating to the newly built Gurdwara on Ross Street, in South Vancouver.
As a result, the oldest existing Gurdwara in Canada today is the
Gur Sikh Temple
, located in
Abbotsford, British Columbia
. Built in 1911, the temple was designated as a
national historic site of Canada
in 2002 and is the third-oldest Gurdwara in the country. Later, the fourth Gurdwara to be built Canada was established in 1912 in
Victoria
on Topaz Avenue, while the fifth soon was built at the
Fraser Mills
(
Coquitlam
) settlement in 1913, followed a few years later by the sixth at the
Queensborough
(
New Westminster
) settlement in 1919,
[
47
]
[
48
]
[

]
and the seventh at the
Paldi
(
Vancouver Island
) settlement, also in 1919.

Attracted by high Canadian wages, early migrants temporarily left their families in search of employment in Canada. In 1906 and 1907, a spike in migration from the Indian subcontinent took place in
British Columbia
, where an estimated 4,747 arrived, at around the same time as a rise in Chinese and Japanese immigration.
[
40
]
[
18
]
[
19
]
This rapid increase in immigration totaled 5,179 by the end of 1908.
[
37
]
[
18
]
[
19
]
With the federal government curtailing the migration, fewer than 125 South Asians were permitted to land in BC over the next several years. Those who had arrived were often single men and many returned to British India or British Hong Kong, while others sought opportunities south of the border in the
United States
, as the
1911 Canadian Census
later revealed the South Asian Canadian population had declined to 2,342 persons or 0.03 percent of the national population.
[
54
]
[
19
]
[
55
]
In support of the vast white population who did not want Indians to immigrate to Canada, the BC government quickly limited the rights and privileges of South Asians.
[
37
]
In 1907, provincial
disenfranchisement
hit the South Asians, who were thus denied the federal vote and access to political office, jury duty, professions, public-service jobs, and labour on
public works
.
[
37
]
[
40
]
The next year, the federal government put into force an
immigration regulation
that specified that migrants must travel to Canada through
continuous journey
from their country of origin. As there were no such system between India and Canada—which the Canadian government knew—the continuous-journey provision therefore prevented the endurance of South Asian immigration. Separating Indian men from their families, this ban would further stifle the growth of the Indo-Canadian community.
[
37
]
[
40
]
[
39
]
Another federal law required new Indian immigrants to carry $200 in cash upon arrival in Canada, whereas European immigrants required only $25 (this fee did not apply to Chinese and Japanese, who were kept out by other measures).

Komagata Maru Incident
, Vancouver, 1914
In November 1913, a Canadian judge overruled an immigration department order for the
deportation
of 38 Punjabis, who had come to Canada via Japan on a regularly scheduled Japanese passenger liner, the
Panama Maru
. They were ordered deported because they had not come by continuous journey from India nor did they carry the requisite amount of money. The judge found fault with the two regulations, ruling both of their wording to be inconsistent with that of the
Immigration Act
and therefore invalid.
[
39
]
With the victory of the
Panama Maru
, whose passengers were allowed to land, the sailing of the
SS Komagata Maru
—a freighter carrying 376 South Asian passengers (all
British subjects
)—took place the following year in April.
[
39
]
On 23 May 1914, upon the eve of the
First World War
, the
Komagata Maru
candidly challenged
the 'continuous journey' regulation when it arrived in
Vancouver
from
Punjab
.
[
39
]
[
54
]
However, although invalidated for a couple months, the 'continuous journey' and $200 requirement provisions returned to force by January 1914, after the Canadian government quickly rewrote its regulations to meet the objections it encountered in court.
[
39
]
The ship had not sailed directly from India; rather, it came to Canada via
Hong Kong
, where it had picked up passengers of Indian descent from
Moji
,
Shanghai
, and
Yokohama
. As expected, most of the passengers were not allowed to enter Canada. Immigration officials consequently isolated the ship in
Vancouver Harbour
for 2 months and was forced to return to Asia.
[
37
]
Viewing this as evidence that Indians were not treated as equals in the Empire, they staged a peaceful protest upon returning to India in
Calcutta
. The colonial authorities in Calcutta responded by dispatching a mixed force of policemen and soldiers, and a subsequent violent encounter between the two parties resulted in the deaths of several protestors.
[
39
]
These events would give further evidence to South Asians of their second-class status within the Empire.
[

]
Queensborough, New Westminster
Sikh temple, 1931.
By 1914, it is estimated that the number of South Asians in British Columbia fell to less than 2,000.
[
54
]
Canada would eventually allow the wives and dependent children of South Asian Canadian residents to immigrate in 1919. Though a small flow of wives and children would be established by the mid-1920s, this did not offset the effect of migration by South Asian Canadians to India and the U.S., which saw the reduction of the South Asian population in Canada to about 1,300 by the mid-1920s.
[
37
]
One of the earliest immigrants from India to settle in
Alberta
was Sohan Singh Bhullar.
[
57
]
Like other Indo-Canadians in Alberta at the time, Bhullar attended the local Black church. The two communities formed close ties due to the marginalization of both communities by wider society. Bhullar's daughter is famed Jazz musician
Judi Singh
.
[

]
Mid–20th century
[
edit
]
With the
independence of India
being an emanant concern, the federal continuous-journey regulation was removed in 1947.
[
37
]
Most of British Columbia's anti-South Asian legislation would also be withdrawn in 1947, and the Indo-Canadian community would be returned the right to vote.
[
37
]
[
40
]
At that time, thousands of people were moved across the nascent borders of the newly established India and Pakistan. Research in Canada suggests that many of the early
Goans
to emigrate to Canada were those who were born and lived in
Karachi
,
Mumbai
(formerly Bombay), and
Kolkata
(formerly Calcutta). Another group of people that arrived in Canada during this period were the
Anglo-Indians
, people of mixed European and Indian ancestry.
[
40
]
In 1951, in place of the continuous-journey provision, the Canadian government would enact an annual
immigration quota
for India (150 per year), Pakistan (100), and Ceylon (50).
[
37
]
At that time, there were only 2,148 South Asians in Canada.
A significant event in Indo-Canadian history occurred in 1950 when 25 years after settling in Canada and nine years after moving to British Columbia from Toronto, Naranjan "Giani" Singh Grewall became the first individual of Indian ancestry in Canada and North America to be elected to public office after successfully running for a position on the board of commissioners in
Mission, BC
against six other candidates.
[

[

[

[

Grewall was re-elected to the board of commissioners in 1952 and by 1954, was elected to became mayor of Mission.

[

[

"Thank you all citizens of Mission City [...] It is a credit to this community to elect the first East Indian to public office in the history of our great dominion. It shows your broad-mindedness, tolerance and consideration."

Notice by Naranjan Singh Grewall in the local Mission newspaper following his election to public office, 1950
A
millwright
and union official, and known as a sportsman and humanitarian philanthropist as well as a lumberman, Grewall eventually established himself as one of the largest employers and most influential business leaders in the northern Fraser Valley, owned six sawmills and was active in community affairs serving on the boards or as chairman of a variety of organizations, and was instrumental in helping create Mission's municipal tree farm.

With strong pro-labour beliefs despite his role as a mill-owner, after a scandal embroiled the provincial Ministry of Forestry under the-then
Social Credit party
government, he referred to holders of forest management licenses across British Columbia as
Timber Maharajahs
, and cautioned that within a decade, three or four giant corporations would predominantly control the entire industry in the province, echoing similarities to the archaic
zamindar
system in South Asia.
[
61
]
[
63
]
He later ran unsuccessfully for the
Co-operative Commonwealth Federation
(the precursor of today's
New Democratic Party
) in the
Dewdney riding
in the
provincial election of 1956
.
[

[

While by the 1950s, Indo-Canadians had gained respect in business in British Columbia primarily for their work in owning sawmills and aiding the development of the provincial forestry industry, racism still existed especially in the upper echelons of society.
[

[

As such, during the campaign period and in the aftermath of running for MLA in 1956, Grewall received personal threats, while the six mills he owned along with his house were all set ablaze by arsonists.

Moderate expansion of immigration increased the Canadian total to 6,774 by 1961, then grew it to 67,925 by 1971. By 2011 the South Asian population in Canada was 1,567,400.
[
37
]
Policies changed rapidly during the second half of the 20th century. Until the late 1950s, essentially all South Asians lived in British Columbia. However, when professional immigrants came to Canada in larger numbers, they began to settle across the country. South Asian politics until 1967 were primarily concerned with changing immigration laws, including the elimination of the legal restrictions enacted by the BC Legislature.
[
37
]
In 1967, all immigration quotas in Canada based on specific ethnic groups were scrapped.
[
40
]
The social view in Canada towards people of other ethnic backgrounds was more open, and Canada was facing declining immigration from European countries, since these European countries had booming postwar economies, and thus more people decided to remain in their home countries.
In 1972, all South Asians were
expelled from Uganda
,
[
37
]
[
67
]
including 80,000 individuals of Indian (mostly
Gujarati
) descent.
[
68
]
[
69
]
Canada accepted 7,000 of them (many of whom were
Ismailis
) as
political refugees
.
[
37
]
From 1977 to 1985, a weaker Canadian economy significantly reduced South-Asian immigration to about 15,000 a year.
[
37
]
In 1978, Canada introduced the
Immigration Act, 1976
, which included a
point-based system
, whereby each applicant would be assessed on their trade skills and the need for these skills in Canada.
[
70
]
This allowed many more Indians to immigrate in large numbers and a trickle of
Goans
(who were English-speaking and Catholic) began to arrive after the
African Great Lakes
countries imposed
Africanization
policies.
[
71
]
The 1970s also saw the beginning of the migration from Fiji, Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago, and Mauritius.
[
37
]
During this decade, thousands of immigrants came yearly and mainly settled in Vancouver and Toronto.
Late 20th century
[
edit
]
In 1986, following the British Columbia provincial election,
Moe Sihota
became the first Indo-Canadian to be elected to provincial parliament. Sihota, who was born in
Duncan, British Columbia
in 1955, ran as the NDP Candidate in the riding of
Esquimalt-Port Renfrew
two years after being involved in municipal politics, as he was elected as an
Alderman
for the city of
Esquimalt
in 1984.
Significant urbanization of the Indo-Canadian community began during the 1980s and early 1990s, when tens of thousands of immigrants moved from India into Canada each year. Forming nearly 20% of the population,
Fort St. James
had the highest proportion of Indo-Canadians of any municipality in Canada during the 1990s.
[
72
]
Prior to the large urban concentrations that exist in the present day, statistically significant populations existed across rural British Columbia; a legacy of previous waves of immigration earlier in the 20th century.
[
72
]
In 1994, approximately 80% of South-Asian Canadians were immigrants.
[
37
]
The settlement pattern in the most recent two decades is still mainly focused around Vancouver and Toronto, but other cities such as Calgary, Edmonton, and Montreal have also become desirable due to growing economic prospects in these cities.
21st century
[
edit
]
During the late 20th and into the early 21st century, India was the third highest source country of immigration to Canada, with roughly 25,000–30,000 Indians immigrating to Canada each year according to
Statistics Canada

In the contemporary era, Canadians with Indian ancestry are from very diverse religious backgrounds compared to many other ethnic groups, which is due in part to India's multi-religious population.
[
77
]
Amongst the Indo-Canadian population however, the religious views are more evenly divided than India, owing in part to historical
chain migration
patterns, witnessed predominantly in the
Sikh-Canadian
community.
A census report detailing the religious proportion breakdown of the South Asian Canadian community was done between 2005 and 2007 by
Statistics Canada
, with results derived from the
2001 Canadian census
.

This report found that among the Indo-Canadian population,
Sikhs
represented 34%, Hindus 27%,

, serving settlers who worked for the Columbia River Lumber Company,
[
43
]
[

]
which would later be destroyed by fire in 1926.
[

The second-oldest gurdwara was built in 1908 in the
Kitsilano
neighbourhood of
Vancouver
and similarly served early settlers who worked at nearby sawmills along
False Creek
at the time.
[
46
]
The temple eventually closed in 1970 as the Sikh population relocated to the
Sunset
neighbourhood of
South Vancouver
.
The oldest gurdwara still in service is the
Gurudwara Gur Sikh Temple
, located in Abbotsford, BC. Built in 1911, the gurdwara was designated as a National Historic Site in 2002.

[
81
]
and over 180 Hindu temples across Canada with almost 100 in the
Greater Toronto Area
alone.
[
82
]
Early in history when Hindus first arrived, the temples were more liberal and catered to all Hindus from different communities. In the past few decades, with the number of Hindu Canadians increasing, Hindu temples have now been established to cater to specific communities of different languages. There are temples for
Punjabis
,
Haryanvis
,
Gujaratis
,
Tamils
,
Bengalis
,
Sindhis
,
Trinidadians
,
Guyanese
, etc.
Within
Toronto
, the largest Hindu temple in Canada is located on Claireville Drive, which is called the
BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir Toronto
. The entire Mandir is 32,000 sq ft (3,000 m
2
) and hosts numerous events on the Hindu religious calendar.
The
Hindu Heritage Centre
is another very large temple and perhaps the second biggest temple at 25,000 sq ft (2,300 m
2
) serving the Hindu community of Brampton and Mississauga. The temple is a very liberal
Sanatani
Dharmic
Hindu temple which caters to the need of all different types of Hindus. Its devotees come from North and South India, as well as Pakistan, Nepal, and the West Indies. The centre is also focused on preserving Hindu culture by teaching a variety of different classes.

Many Indian Muslims along with Muslims of other nationalities worship at one of the largest mosques in Canada, the
ISNA Centre
, located in Mississauga. The facility contains a mosque, high school, community centre, banquet hall and funeral service available for all Muslim Canadians.
The Ismailis have the first Ismaili Jamatkhana and Centre set up in
Burnaby
, British Columbia. This high-profile building is the second in the world, with other locations in
London
,
Lisbon
, and
Dubai
. A second such building is in Toronto.

Syriac Orthodox Church
,
Assemblies of God in India
,

Indo-Canadians in Toronto
Toronto has the largest Indo-Canadian population in Canada. Almost 51% of the entire Indo-Canadian community resides in the
Greater Toronto Area
. Most Indo-Canadians in the Toronto area live in
Brampton
,
Markham
,
Scarborough
,
Etobicoke
, and
Mississauga
. Indo-Canadians, particularly,
Punjabi Sikhs
and
Punjabi Hindus
, have a particularly strong presence in Brampton, where they represent about a third of the population (Most live in the northeastern and eastern portion of the city). The area is middle and upper middle class, home ownership is very high. The Indo-Canadians in this region are mostly of Punjabi, Telugu, Tamil, Bengali, Gujarati, Marathi, Malayali and Goan origin. When compared to the Indo-Canadian community of Greater Vancouver, the Greater Toronto Area is home to a much more diverse community of Indians – both linguistically and religiously.
Air India
and
Air Canada
operates flights from
Toronto Pearson International Airport
back to India.
Indo-Canadians in the Greater Toronto Area have an average household income of $86,425, which is higher than the Canadian average of $79,102 but lower than the Toronto Census Metropolitan Area's average of $95,326. Indo-Canadian students are also well-represented in Toronto-area universities; despite Indo-Canadians making up 10% of the Toronto area's population, students of Indian origin (domestic and international combined) make up over 35% of
Toronto Metropolitan University
, 30% of
York University
, and 20% of the
University of Toronto
's student bodies, respectively.

Canada's largest Hindu Mandir, the
BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir Toronto
, as well as Canada's largest Sikh gurdwara, the
Ontario Khalsa Darbar
, are both located in the Greater Toronto Area. Both have been built by Canada's Indian community.

Indo-Canadians in Greater Vancouver
Vancouver is home to the second largest Indo-Canadian population in Canada, with just over 20% of the entire Indo-Canadian community residing in the Lower Mainland.
[

]
The highest density concentrations of Indo-Canadians are found in
Vancouver
,
Surrey
,
Burnaby
,
Richmond
,
Abbotsford
and
Delta
. Recently, more Indians have been moving to other areas outside of
Greater Vancouver
. The city of
Surrey
has nearly 170,000 South Asians,
[
95
]
comprising 32% of the city's population.
[
96
]
The
Punjabi Market
neighbourhood of South Vancouver also has a particularly high concentration of Indian residents, shops and restaurants.
[
97
]
A large majority of Indo-Canadians within Vancouver are of
Punjabi
Sikh
origin.
[
98
]
However, there are also populations with other ethnic backgrounds including
Indo-Fijians
,
Gujarati
,
Sindhi
,
Tamil
,
Bengali
, and
Goans
.
[

In addition to tracing their origin directly to the
Indian subcontinent
, many Indo-Canadians who arrive in Canada come from other parts of the world, as part of the global
Indian diaspora
.

Indians have also moved to Canada from Southern African nations such as
Zambia
,
Malawi
and
South Africa
for similar reasons. Examples of successful Indo-Canadians from this migratory stream are
Suhana Meharchand
and Nirmala Naidoo, television newscasters of Indian descent from South Africa, who currently work for the
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation
(CBC).
Indira Naidoo-Harris
is another Canadian broadcaster who is of Indian descent from South Africa.
Two of the most high-profile Indo-Africans are CNN's
Zain Verjee
and
Ali Velshi
. Verjee was educated in Canada while Velshi's father
Murad Velshi
who immigrated from South Africa was the first MPP of Indian descent to sit in the Ontario legislature.
The most notable story of Indo-African immigration to Canada is set in the 1970s, when in 1972 50,000
Indian
Ugandans
were forced out of
Uganda
by the dictator
Idi Amin
, and were not permitted to return to India by the Indian government. Although on the brink of facing torture and imprisonment on a massive scale, the
Aga Khan IV
, leader of the
Nizari Ismaili
Community, specially negotiated his followers' safe departure from Uganda in exchange for all their belongings. He also negotiated their guaranteed asylum in Canada with Prime Minister and close friend
Pierre Elliott Trudeau
.
A notable descendant of Ugandan Indian settlement in Canada is
Irshad Manji
, an acclaimed advocate for
secularism
and
reform
in
Islam
. The community of Goans is also mainly from the African Great Lakes.

Indo-Caribbean people are Caribbean people with roots in India.
The Indo-Caribbean Canadian community has developed a unique cultural blend of both Indian and Caribbean culture due to a long period of isolation from India, amongst other reasons. Some Indo-Caribbean Canadians associate themselves with the Indo-Canadian community. However, most associate with the
Indo-Caribbean
community or the wider Caribbean community or with both. Most mainly live within the
Greater Toronto Area
or Southern Ontario.

Some Indians have immigrated from the
United Kingdom
and the
United States
due to both economic and family reasons. Indians move for economic prospects to Canada's economy and job market and have been performing well against many European and some American states. Lastly, individuals have decided to settle in Canada in order to reunite their families who may have settled in both the United States and the UK and not in Canada.

Many Indians have been moving from countries in the Middle East to North America.
Most Indian immigrants from the Middle East are Indian businessmen and professionals that worked in the Middle Eastern countries like the
United Arab Emirates
, Bahrain,
Oman
,
Kuwait
,
Qatar
and
Saudi Arabia
. A key priority for these immigrants is educational opportunities for their children post-schooling. Many of these students have stayed back after graduation and started their families there.

Indians have long been settled in certain parts of
Oceania
, mainly on some islands in
Fiji
, where they comprise approximately 40% of Fiji's population. Since Fiji's independence, increased hostility between the Melanesian Fijian population and the
Indo-Fijian
population has led to several significant confrontations politically. Notably, since the two coups d'état of 1987 many Indo-Fijians are moving from Fiji to US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand due to political instability and ethnic conflict. A majority of the Indo-Fijian immigrants have settled in
British Columbia
and
Alberta
, with a significant population in the
Greater Toronto Area
as well, most of whom are Hindus, with a significant portion of Muslims. Other religions that are practised are Christianity and Sikhism. The Indo-Fijian population in Canada is not as diverse religiously as the general Indo-Canadian community. Indo-Fijians have established cultural centres and organisations in Vancouver,
Surrey
,
Burnaby
,
Edmonton
,
Calgary
and
Toronto
. The biggest Indo-Fijian cultural centre in Canada is the
Fiji Sanatan Society of Alberta
in Edmonton, built in 1984 by some of the first Indo-Fijian immigrants in Edmonton, it is officially a Hindu temple, but also hosts many community events.

Indo-Canadian culture is closely linked to each specific Indian group's religious, regional, linguistic and ethnic backgrounds. For instance, Northern Indian cultural practices and languages differ from those of Southern Indians, and the Hindu community's cultural practices differ from those of the
Jain
, Sikh, Muslim, Christian and Jewish communities due to differences in ethnicity, regional affiliation, religion and/or language. Such cultural aspects have been preserved fairly well due to Canada's open policy of
multiculturalism
, similar to the policy of
multicultural diversity
practised by the
United States
.
The cultures and languages of various Indian communities have been able to thrive in part due to the freedom of these communities to establish structures and institutions for religious worship, social interaction, and cultural practices. In particular, Punjabi culture and language have been reinforced in Canada through radio and television.
Alternatively, Indo-Canadian culture has developed its own identity compared to other non-resident Indians and from people in India. It is not uncommon to find youth uninterested with traditional Indian cultural elements and events, instead of identifying with mainstream North American cultural mores. However such individuals exist in a minority and there are many youth that maintain a balance between western and eastern cultural values, and occasionally fusing the two to produce a new product, such as the new generation of
Bhangra
incorporating hip-hop based rhythm. For instance, Sikh youth often mix in traditional Bhangra, which uses Punjabi instruments with hip hop beats as well as including rap with Black music entertainers. Notable entertainers include
Raghav
and
Jazzy B
.
Marriage
[
edit
]

Marriage is an important cultural element amongst many Indo-Canadians, due to their Indian heritage and religious background.
[
104
]
Arranged marriage
, which is still widely practised in India, is no longer widely practised among Canadian-born or naturalized Indians. However, marriages are sometimes still arranged by parents within their specific caste or Indian ethnic community. Since it may be difficult to find someone of the same Indian ethnic background with the desired characteristics, some Indo-Canadians now opt to use
matrimonial
services, including online services, in order to find a marriage partner. Marriage practices amongst Indo-Canadians are not as liberal as those of their Indian counterparts, with caste sometimes considered, but dowries almost non-existent.
[

In 2012, Mandeep Kaur wrote a PhD thesis titled "Canadian-Punjabi Philanthropy and its Impact on Punjab: A Sociological Study", which found that, compared to other ethnic groups, Indo-Canadians engage in more arranged marriages within ethnic communities and castes and engage in less dating; this is because these Indo-Canadian communities wish to preserve their cultural practices.
[

Media
[
edit
]
There are numerous radio programs that represent Indo-Canadian culture. One notable program is
Geetmala Radio
, hosted by Darshan and Arvinder Sahota (also longtime television hosts of Indo-Canadian program,
Eye on Asia
).
A number of Canadian television networks broadcast programming that features Indo-Canadian culture. One prominent multicultural/multireligious channel,
Vision TV
, presents a nonstop marathon of Indo-Canadian shows on Saturdays. These television shows often highlight Indo-Canadian events in Canada, and also show events from India involving Indians who reside there. In addition, other networks such as
Omni Television
,
CityTV
, and local community access channels also present local Indo-Canadian content, and Indian content from India.
[

In recent years,
[
when?
]
there has been an establishment of Indian television networks from India on Canadian television. Shan Chandrasehkhar, an established Indo-Canadian who pioneered one of the first Indo-Canadian television shows in Canada, made a deal with the
Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission
(CRTC) to allow Indian television networks based in India to send a direct feed to Canada. In doing so, he branded these channels under his own company known as the
Asian Television Network
. Since 1997, Indo-Canadians can subscribe to channels from India via purchasing TV channel packages from their local satellite/cable companies. Indo-Canadians view such networks as
Zee TV
,
B4U
,
Sony Entertainment Television
, and
Aaj Tak
to name a few. Goan communities are connected by a number of city-based websites that inform the community of local activities such as dances, religious services, and village feasts, that serve to connect the community to its rural origins in Goa.
[
106
]
Radio stations in the
Greater Toronto Area
with Indo Canadian content include
CJSA-FM
broadcasting on 101.3FM. Another station is
CINA
broadcasting on AM 1650.
Major newspapers include
Canindia News
in Toronto & Montreal,
The Asian Star
and
The Punjabi Star
in Vancouver.
As of 2012, there are many Punjabi newspapers, most of which are published in Vancouver and Toronto. As of that year, 50 of them are weekly, two are daily, and others are monthly.
[
105
]
By 2012, partly due to coverage of
Air India Flight 182
, coverage of Punjabi issues in
The Globe and Mail
, the
Vancouver Sun
, and other mainstream Canadian newspapers had increased.
