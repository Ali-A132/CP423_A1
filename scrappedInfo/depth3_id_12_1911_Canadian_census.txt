Methodology
[
edit
]
The census was conducted by the
Canadian Ministry of Agriculture
under the authority of the Census and Statistics Act of 1905. 9,703 enumerators visited homes across the country, asked the required questions and recorded the responses from each household onto paper forms. For the census, each province or territory was subdivided into districts, usually based on electoral districts, cities or counties, which were in turn divided into sub-districts, which were towns, townships, city wards or parishes. One handwritten line in
English
or
French
was entered for each person enumerated. The responses were collected, tabulated and summary statistics were produced. In 1955, the paper records of responses were
microfilmed
and the original paper forms were destroyed.

The microfilm has since been scanned and converted into a series of images which are now available online at the
Library and Archives Canada
web site.
