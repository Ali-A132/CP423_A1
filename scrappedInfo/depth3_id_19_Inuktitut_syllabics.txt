,
romanized
:
qaniujaaqpait
,
[

]
or
ᑎᑎᕋᐅᓯᖅ ᓄᑖᖅ
,

) is an
abugida
-type
writing system
used in Canada by the
Inuktitut
-speaking
Inuit
of the
territory
of
Nunavut
and the
Nunavik
region of
Quebec
. In 1976, the Language Commission of the Inuit Cultural Institute made it the co-official script for the
Inuit languages
, along with the
Latin script
.
The name
qaniujaaqpait
[qaniujaːqpaˈit]
derives from the root
qaniq
, meaning "mouth". The alternative, Latin-based writing system is named
qaliujaaqpait
(
ᖃᓕᐅᔮᖅᐸᐃᑦ
), and it derives from
qaliit
, a word describing the markings or the grain in rocks.
Titirausiq nutaaq
[titiʁauˈsiq
nuˈtaːq]
meaning "new writing system" is to be seen in contrast to
titirausiit nutaunngittut
(
ᑎᑎᕋᐅᓰᑦ ᓄᑕᐅᓐᖏᑦᑐᑦ
), the "old syllabics" used before the reforms of 1976.

History
[
edit
]
The first efforts to write Inuktitut came from
Moravian
missionaries in
Greenland
and
Labrador
in the mid-19th century using Latin script. The first book printed in Inuktitut using
Cree script
was an 8-page pamphlet known as
Selections from the
Gospels
in the dialect of the Inuit of
Little Whale River
(
ᒋᓴᓯᑊ ᐅᑲᐤᓯᐣᑭᐟ
, "Jesus' words"),
[

]
printed by
John Horden
in 1855–56 at
Moose Factory
for Edwin Arthur Watkins to use among the Inuit at
Fort George
. In November 1865, Horden and Watkins met in London under
Henry Venn
's direction to adapt
Cree syllabics
to the Inuktitut language.
[

]
In the 1870s,
Edmund Peck
, another
Anglican
missionary, started printing according to that standard. Other missionaries, and later linguists in the employ of the
Canadian
and
American
governments, adapted the Latin alphabet to the dialects of the
Mackenzie River
delta, the western
Arctic islands
and
Alaska
.

For
geminate consonants
, the final consonant symbol is placed before the CV syllabic, for instance

Modifications
[
edit
]
The
Makivik Corporation
expanded the official version of the script to restore the
ai-pai-tai
column. The common
diphthong
ai
has generally been represented by combining the
a
form with a stand-alone letter ᐃ
i.
[
example needed
]
This fourth-vowel variant had been removed so that Inuktitut could be typed and printed using
IBM
Selectric balls
in the 1970s. The reinstatement was justified on the grounds that modern printing and typesetting equipment no longer suffers the restrictions of earlier typewriting machinery. The
ai-pai-tai
column is used only in Nunavik.
