Canadian Confederation
(French:
Confédération canadienne
) was the process by which three
British North American
provinces—the
Province of Canada
,
Nova Scotia
, and
New Brunswick
—were united into one
federation
, called the
Dominion
of
Canada
, on July 1, 1867.
[
1
]
[
2
]
This process occurred in accordance with the rising tide of
Canadian nationalism
that was then beginning to swell within these provinces and others. Upon Confederation,
Canada
consisted of four provinces:
Ontario
and
Quebec
, which had been split out from the Province of Canada, and the provinces of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.
[
3
]
The province of
Prince Edward Island
, which had hosted the first meeting to consider Confederation, the
Charlottetown Conference
, did not join Confederation until 1873. Over the years since Confederation, Canada has seen numerous territorial changes and expansions, resulting in the current number of
ten provinces and three territories
.
Terminology
[
edit
]
Confederation
[
edit
]
Canada is a
federation
,
[
4
]
rather than a confederate association of sovereign states, which is what
confederation
means in contemporary political theory. The country, though, is often considered to be among the world's more
decentralized
federations.
[
5
]
Use of the term
confederation
arose in the Province of Canada to refer to proposals beginning in the 1850s to federate all of the British North American colonies, as opposed to only Canada West (now Ontario) and Canada East (now Quebec). To contemporaries of Confederation, the
con-
prefix indicated a strengthening of the centrist principle compared to the American federation.
[
6
]
In this Canadian context,
confederation
describes the political process that united the colonies in 1867, events related to that process, and the subsequent incorporation of other colonies and territories.
[
7
]
The word is now often used to describe Canada in an abstract way, such as in "the Fathers of Confederation"; provinces that became part of Canada after 1867 are also said to have
joined, or entered into, Confederation
(but not
the
Confederation).
[
8
]
The term is also used to divide
Canadian history
into pre-Confederation and post-Confederation periods.

Fathers of Confederation
[
edit
]
Main article:
Fathers of Confederation
The Fathers of Confederation
The original Fathers of Confederation are those delegates who attended any of the conferences held at Charlottetown and Quebec in 1864 or in London, United Kingdom, in 1866, leading to Confederation.
[
10
]
There were 36 original Fathers of Confederation;
Hewitt Bernard
, who was the recording secretary at the
Charlottetown Conference
, is considered by some to be among them.
[
11
]
The individuals who brought the other provinces into Confederation after 1867 are also referred to as
Fathers of Confederation
. In this way,
Amor De Cosmos
, who was instrumental both in bringing democracy to British Columbia and in bringing the province into Confederation, is considered to be a Father of Confederation.
[
12
]
As well,
Joey Smallwood
referred to himself as "the Last Father of Confederation" because he helped lead
Newfoundland
into the union in 1949.

History

Colonial organization
[

Sir
William Alexander
All the
former colonies and territories
that became involved in the Canadian Confederation on July 1, 1867, were initially part of
New France
, and were once ruled by
France
.
[
14
]
Nova Scotia
was granted in 1621 to
Sir William Alexander
under
charter
by
James I
.
[
14
]
This claim overlapped the French claims to
Acadia
, and although the
Scottish colony
of Nova Scotia was short-lived, for political reasons, the conflicting imperial interests of France and the 18th century
Great Britain
led to a long and bitter struggle for control. The British acquired present-day mainland Nova Scotia by the
Treaty of Utrecht
of 1713 and the
Acadian population was expelled
by the British in 1755. They renamed Acadia "Nova Scotia", which included present-day
New Brunswick
.
[
14
]
The rest of New France was acquired by the British as the result of its defeat of New France in the
Seven Years' War
, which ended with the
Treaty of Paris
in 1763. From 1763 to 1791, most of New France became the
Province of Quebec
.
[
14
]
However, in 1769 the present-day
Prince Edward Island
, which had been part of Acadia, was renamed "St John's Island" and organized as a separate colony.
[
15
]
It was renamed "Prince Edward Island" in 1798 in honour of
Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn
.
[
15
]
The first
English attempt at settlement
on that part of the continent that would become modern Canada had been in
Newfoundland
which would not join Confederation until 1949.
[
16
]
The
Society of Merchant Venturers
of
Bristol
began to settle
Newfoundland and Labrador
at
Cuper's Cove
as far back as 1610, and Newfoundland had also been the subject of
a French colonial enterprise
.
[
17
]
During and after the
U.S. War of Independence
, an estimated 50,000
United Empire Loyalists
fled to
British North America
.
[
14
]
The British created the separate province of New Brunswick in 1784 for Loyalists who settled in the western part of Nova Scotia.
[
18
]
Nova Scotia (including New Brunswick) received slightly more than half of this influx, and many Loyalists settled in the Province of Quebec, which later by the
Constitutional Act 1791
was separated into a predominantly English
Upper Canada
and a predominantly French
Lower Canada
.
[
19
]
The
War of 1812
and
Treaty of 1818
established the border between British North America and the United States at the
49th parallel
from the
Great Lakes
to the
Rocky Mountains
in Western Canada.
[

]
Canadian territory at Confederation
Following the
Rebellions of 1837
,
Lord Durham
in his
Durham Report
, recommended Upper and Lower Canada be joined as the
Province of Canada
and the new province should have a
responsible government
.
[
21
]
As a result of Durham's report, the British Parliament passed the
Act of Union 1840
, and the Province of Canada was formed in 1841.
[
22
]
The new province had two parts:
Canada West
(the former Upper Canada, today's Ontario) and
Canada East
(the former Lower Canada, today's Quebec).
[
22
]
Governor General
Lord Elgin
granted ministerial responsibility in 1848, first to Nova Scotia and then to the Province of Canada. Later, the British parliament extended responsible government to Prince Edward Island (1851), New Brunswick (1854), and Newfoundland (1855).
[
23
]
The area constituting modern-day
British Columbia
is the remnants of the
Hudson's Bay Company
's
Columbia District
and
New Caledonia District
following the
Oregon Treaty
. Before joining Canada in 1871, British Columbia consisted of the separate
Colony of British Columbia
(formed in 1858, in an area where the Crown had granted a monopoly to the Hudson's Bay Company), and the
Colony of Vancouver Island
(formed in 1849) constituting a separate
crown colony
until it was united with the colony of British Columbia in 1866.
[
24
]
The remainder of modern-day Canada was made up of
Rupert's Land
and the
North-Western Territory
(both of which were controlled by the
Hudson's Bay Company
and sold to Canada in 1870) and the
Arctic Islands
, which were under direct British control and became a part of Canada in 1880.
[
25
]
Plus, Newfoundland and Labrador joined Canada in 1949.
Early attempts
[
edit
]
The idea of joining the various colonies in North America was being floated as early as 1814. That year,
Chief Justice of Lower Canada
Jonathan Sewell
sent a copy of his report,
A Plan for the federal Union of British Provinces in North America
, to
Prince Edward
(both a son of King
George III
and the father of
Queen Victoria
), whom Sewell had befriended when they both resided in
Quebec City
. Edward replied, "nothing can be better arranged than the whole thing is, or more perfectly", going on to suggest a unified Canada consisting of two provinces—one formed from Upper and Lower Canada and the other from the Maritime colonies—each with a lieutenant governor and executive council, one located in
Montreal
and the other in either
Annapolis Royal
or
Windsor
.
[
26
]
Edward said he would pass the report on to
the Earl Bathurst
, the then-
Secretary of State for War and the Colonies
; the Prince's comments and critiques were later cited by both the Earl of Durham and participants of the
Charlottetown
and
Quebec Conferences
.
George-Étienne Cartier
Lord Durham presented his idea of unification in 1839
Report on the Affairs of British North America
,
[
27
]
which resulted in the Act of Union 1840. Beginning in 1857,
Joseph-Charles Taché
proposed a federation in a series of 33 articles published in the
Courrier du Canada
.
[
28
]
Two years later,
Alexander Tilloch Galt
,
George-Étienne Cartier
, and
John Ross
travelled to the United Kingdom to present the British Parliament with a project for confederation of the British colonies. The proposal was received by the London authorities with polite indifference.
The
royal tour of British North America
undertaken by Queen Victoria's son, Prince Albert Edward (later King
Edward VII
) in 1860, however, helped lead to the unification of the colonies by confirming a common bond between their inhabitants;
[
29
]
indeed, the monarchy played a "pivotal legal and symbolic role [...] in cementing the new Canadian union".
[
30
]
Further, by 1864, it was clear that continued governance of the Province of Canada under the terms of the 1840 Act of Union had become impracticable. Therefore, a
grand coalition
of parties, the
Great Coalition
, formed in order to reform the political system.
[
31
]
Queen Victoria remarked on "the impossibility of our being able to hold Canada; but, we must struggle for it; and by far the best solution would be to let it go as an independent kingdom under an English prince."
[
32
]
Influences leading to Confederation
[
edit
]
Several factors influenced Confederation, caused both by internal sources and pressures from external sources.
[
36
]
Internally, there was political deadlock resulting from the contemporary governmental structure in the Province of Canada and distrust between English Protestants and French Catholics.
[
37
]
Further, demographic pressure from an expanding population and economic nationalism wanting economic development butted against a lack of an inter-colonial railroad, which hampered trade, military movement, and transportation in general.
[
38
]
Externally, the
Canadian–American Reciprocity Treaty
(a free trade policy, starting in 1854, whereby products were allowed into the United States without taxes or tariffs, which was then considered to be beneficial for Canada) was cancelled by the United States in 1865, partly as revenge against Britain for unofficial support of the south in the
American Civil War
. Additionally, the U.S. doctrine of "
manifest destiny
" raised fears of another American invasion (Canadians had fended off American incursions during the Revolutionary War, War of 1812,
Fenian raids
, and
St. Albans Raid
[
39
]
), only further inflamed by the
Alaska Purchase
of March 30, 1867, which had been supported in the U.S. Senate (by
Charles Sumner
among others) precisely in terms of taking the remainder of North America from the British. The American Civil War had also horrified Canadians and turned many from the thought of republicanism.
[
40
]
In Britain, political pressure came from financiers who had lost money by investing in the failed
Grand Trunk Railway
and the
little Englander
philosophy fed a desire to withdraw troops from Britain's colonies.
Ideological origins and philosophical dimensions
[
edit
]
Map of the Eastern British Provinces in North America at the time of Canadian Confederation, 1867
There is extensive scholarly debate on the role of political ideas in Canadian Confederation. Traditionally, historians regarded Canadian Confederation an exercise in political pragmatism that was essentially non-ideological. In the 1960s, historian
Peter Waite
derided the references to political philosophers in the legislative debates on Confederation as "hot air". In Waite's view, Confederation was driven by pragmatic brokerage politics and competing interest groups.
[
41
]
In 1987, political scientist Peter J. Smith challenged the view Canadian Confederation was non-ideological. Smith argued Confederation was motivated by new political ideologies as much as the American and French Revolutions and Canadian Confederation was driven by a
Court Party
ideology. Smith traces the origins of this ideology to eighteenth and nineteenth-century Britain, where political life was polarized between defenders of
classical republican
values of the
Country Party
and proponents of a new pro-capitalist ideology of the Court Party, which believed in centralizing political power. In British North America in the late 1860s, the Court Party tradition was represented by the supporters of Confederation, whereas the anti-capitalist and agrarian Country Party tradition was embodied by the Anti-Confederates.
[
42
]
In a 2000 journal article, historian
Ian McKay
argued Canadian Confederation was motivated by the ideology of liberalism and the belief in the supremacy of individual rights. McKay described Confederation as part of the classical liberal project of creating a "liberal order" in northern North America.
[
43
]
Many Canadian historians have adopted McKay's liberal order framework as a paradigm for understanding Canadian history.
[
44
]
In 2008, historian Andrew Smith advanced a very different view of Confederation's ideological origins. He argues that in the four original Canadian provinces, the politics of taxation were a central issue in the debate about Confederation. Taxation was also central to the debate in Newfoundland, the tax-averse colony that rejected it. Smith argued Confederation was supported by many colonists who were sympathetic to a relatively interventionist, or statist, approach to capitalist development. Most classical liberals, who believed in free trade and low taxes, opposed Confederation because they feared it would result in Big Government. The struggle over Confederation involved a battle between a staunch individualist economic philosophy and a comparatively collectivist view of the state's proper role in the economy. According to Smith, the victory of the
statist
supporters of Confederation over their
anti-statist
opponents prepared the way for
John A. Macdonald
's government to enact the protectionist National Policy and to subsidize major infrastructure projects such as the
Intercolonial
and
Pacific
Railways.
[
45
]
In 2007, political scientist
Janet Ajzenstat
connected Canadian Confederation to the individualist ideology of
John Locke
. She argued that the union of the British North American colonies was motivated by a desire to protect individual rights, especially the rights to life, liberty, and property. She contends the Fathers of Confederation were motivated by the values of the
Enlightenment
of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. She argues their intellectual debts to Locke are most evident when one looks at the 1865 debates in the Province of Canada's legislature on whether or not union with the other British North American colonies would be desirable.

Main article:
Charlottetown Conference
In the spring of 1864,
New Brunswick premier
Samuel Leonard Tilley
,
Nova Scotia premier
Charles Tupper
, and
Prince Edward Island premier
John Hamilton Gray
were contemplating the idea of a
Maritime Union
which would join their three colonies together.
[

Delegates of the
Charlottetown Conference

Government House
, September 1864
The government of the Province of Canada surprised the Maritime governments by asking if the Province of Canada could be included in the negotiations. The request was channelled through the governor general, Monck, to London and accepted by the Colonial Office.
[
48
]
After several years of legislative paralysis in the Province of Canada caused by the need to maintain a double legislative majority (a majority of both the Canada East and Canada West delegates in the Province of Canada's legislature), Macdonald had led his
Liberal-Conservative Party
into the Great Coalition with Cartier's
Parti bleu
and
George Brown
's
Clear Grits
.
[
49
]
Macdonald, Cartier, and Brown felt union with the other British colonies might be a way to solve the political problems of the Province of Canada.
[
49
]
The
Charlottetown Conference
began on September 1, 1864. Since the agenda for the meeting had already been set, the delegation from the Province of Canada was initially not an official part of the Conference. The issue of Maritime Union was deferred and the Canadians were formally allowed to join and address the Conference.
[
50
]
No minutes from the Charlottetown Conference survive, but it is known Cartier and Macdonald presented arguments in favour of a union of the three colonies,
[
51
]
Alexander Tilloch Galt presented the Province of Canada's proposals on the financial arrangements of such a union,
[
51
]
and George Brown presented a proposal for what form a united government might take.
[
52
]
The Canadian delegation's proposal for the governmental system involved:
preservation of ties with Great Britain
residual jurisdiction left to a central authority
a bicameral system including a Lower House with representation by population (rep by pop) and an Upper House with representation based on regional, rather than provincial, equality
responsible government at the federal and provincial levels
the appointment of a
Canadian governor general
by the
British Crown
Other proposals attractive to the politicians from the Maritime colonies were:
assumption of provincial debt by the central government
[
53
]
revenues from the central government apportioned to the provinces on the basis of population
[
53
]
the building of an intercolonial railway to link Montreal and Halifax, giving Canada access to an ice-free winter port and the Maritimes easy access to Canada and
Rupert's Land
[
54
]
By September 7, 1864, the delegates from Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island gave a positive answer to the Canadian delegation, expressing the view the federation of all of the provinces was considered desirable if the terms of union could be made satisfactory
[
55
]
and the question of Maritime Union was waived.
[
52
]
After the Conference adjourned on September 9, there were further meetings between delegates held at
Halifax
,
Saint John
, and
Fredericton
.
[
56
]
[
57
]
These meetings evinced enough interest that the delegates decided to hold a second Conference.

Delegates' reactions
[
edit
]
One of the most important purposes of the Charlottetown Conference was the introduction of Canadians to the leaders from the Maritime Provinces and vice versa. At this point, there was no railway link from Quebec City to Halifax, and the people of each region had little to do with one another.
Thomas D'Arcy McGee
was one of the few Canadian delegates who had been to the Maritimes, when he had gone down earlier that summer with a trade mission of Canadian businessmen, journalists and politicians.
[
57
]
George Brown remarked in a letter to his wife Anne that at a party given by the premier of PEI, Colonel John Hamilton Gray, he met a woman who had never been off the island in her entire life. Nevertheless, he found Prince Edward Islanders to be "amazingly civilized".
[
55
]
Press and popular reaction
[
edit
]
Reaction to the Charlottetown Conference varied among the different newspapers. In the Maritimes, there was concern that the smooth Canadians with their sparkling champagne and charming speeches were outsmarting the delegates of the smaller provinces. "From all accounts it looks as if these [Canadian] gentlemen had it all their own way; ... and that, what with their arguments and what with their blandishments, (they gave a champagne lunch on board the
Victoria
where Mr. McGee's wit sparkled brightly as the wine), they carried the Lower Province delegates a little off their feet."
[
58
]
The delegates from the Quebec conference considered if the resolutions would be better suited for acceptance if a popular vote were held on them. However, due to the divide amongst religious groups and general mistrust between areas in Canada, they believed that such a vote would be defeated. Thus, they went ahead with the resolutions on their own volition.

Quebec Conference
[

Main articles:
Quebec Conference, 1864
and
Quebec Resolutions
After returning home from the Charlottetown Conference, Macdonald asked
Viscount Monck
, the
governor general of the Province of Canada
to invite delegates from the three Maritime provinces and Newfoundland to a conference with United Canada delegates. At the opening of the conference, a total of 33 delegates were included from the British North American Colonies, including Newfoundland, which had not participated in prior meetings.
[
60
]
Monck obliged and the Conference went ahead at
Quebec City
in October 1864.
Delegates at the
Quebec Conference
, October 1864
The Conference began on October 10, 1864, on the site of present-day Montmorency Park.
[
61
]
The Conference elected
Étienne-Paschal Taché
as its chairman, but it was dominated by Macdonald. Despite differences in the positions of some of the delegates on some issues, the Quebec Conference, following so swiftly on the success of the Charlottetown Conference, was infused with a determinative sense of purpose and
nationalism
.
[
62
]
For the Reformers of Canada West, led by George Brown, the end of what they perceived as French-Canadian interference in local affairs was in sight.
[
63
]
For Maritimers such as Tupper of Nova Scotia or Tilley of New Brunswick, horizons were suddenly broadened to take in much larger possibilities for trade and growth.
[
63
]
On the issue of the Senate, the Maritime Provinces pressed for as much equality as possible. With the addition of Newfoundland to the Conference, the three Maritime colonies did not wish to see the strength of their provinces in the upper chamber diluted by simply adding Newfoundland to the Atlantic category.
[
64
]
It was the matter of the Senate that threatened to derail the entire proceedings.
[
65
]
It was Macdonald who came up with the acceptable compromise of giving Newfoundland four senators of its own when it joined.
[
65
]
The delegates from the Maritimes also raised an issue with respect to the level of government—federal or provincial—that would be given the powers not otherwise specifically defined. Macdonald, who was aiming for the strongest central government possible, insisted this was to be the central government, and in this, he was supported by, among others, Tupper.
[
66
]
At the end of the Conference, it adopted the "
seventy-two resolutions
" which would form the basis of a scheduled future conference. The Conference adjourned on October 27.
Prince Edward Island emerged disappointed from the Quebec Conference. It did not receive support for a guarantee of six members in the proposed House of Commons, and was denied an appropriation of $200,000 it felt had been offered at Charlottetown to assist in
buying out the holdings of absentee landlords
.
[
67
]
Press and popular reaction
[
edit
]
"Never was there such an opportunity as now for the birth of a nation" proclaimed a pamphlet written by S. E. Dawson and reprinted in a Quebec City newspaper during the Conference.
[
65
]
Again, reaction to the Quebec Conference varied depending on the political views of the critic.
Constitutional scheme discussed in London
[
edit
]
George Brown was the first, in December 1864, to carry the constitutional proposals to the British government in London, where Brown received "a most gracious answer to our constitutional scheme".
[
68
]
He also met with William Gladstone—who was then Chancellor of the Exchequer and, later, Prime Minister—"who agreed in almost everything".
[
68
]
In April 1865, Brown, Macdonald, Cartier and Galt met with the government and found "the project of a federal union of the colonies was highly approved of by the imperial authorities".
[
69
]
On the form of the proposed system of governance for Canada, the Fathers of Confederation were influenced by the American republic. Macdonald said in 1865:
By adhering to the monarchical principle, we avoid one defect inherent in the
constitution of the United States
. By the election of the president by a majority and for a short period, he never is the sovereign and chief of the nation. He is never looked up to by the whole people as the head and front of the nation. He is, at best, but the successful leader of a party. This defect is all the greater on account of the practice of reelection. During his first term of office, he is employed in taking steps to secure his own reelection and, for his party, a continuance of power. We avoid this by adhering to the monarchical principle—the sovereign, whom you respect and love. I believe that it is of the utmost importance to have that principle recognized so that we shall have a sovereign who is placed above the region of party—to whom all parties look up; who is not elevated by the action of one party nor depressed by the action of another; who is the common head and sovereign of all.

London Conference
[

Main article:
London Conference of 1866
Queen Victoria
granted
royal assent
to the
British North America Act
on March 29, 1867
Following the Quebec Conference, the Province of Canada's legislature passed a bill approving the union. The union proved more controversial in the Maritime provinces, however, and it was not until 1866 that New Brunswick and Nova Scotia passed union resolutions, while Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland continued to opt against joining.
In December 1866, sixteen delegates from the Province of Canada, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia travelled to London, where
the Earl of Carnarvon
presented each to
Queen Victoria
in private
audience
,
[
71
]
as well as holding court for their wives and daughters.
[
72
]
To the Nova Scotian delegates, the Queen said, "I take the deepest interest in [Confederation], for I believe it will make [the provinces] great and prosperous."
[
73
]
At meetings held at the Westminster Palace Hotel, the delegates reviewed and approved the 72 resolutions; although Charles Tupper had promised to anti-union forces in Nova Scotia that he would push for amendments, he was unsuccessful in getting any passed. Now known as the
London Resolutions
, the conference's decisions were forwarded to the
Colonial Office
.
After breaking for Christmas, the delegates reconvened in January 1867 and began drafting the
British North America Act
. The 4th Earl of Carnarvon continued to have a central role in drafting the act at
Highclere Castle
alongside the first
prime minister of Canada
Macdonald, Cartier and Galt, who signed the visitor book in 1866.
[
74
]
After suggestions of 'Franklin' and 'Guelfenland',
[
71
]
they agreed the new country should be called
Canada
, Canada East should be renamed
Quebec
and Canada West should be renamed
Ontario
.
[
75
]
There was, however, heated debate about how the new country should be designated. Ultimately, the delegates elected to call the new country the Dominion of Canada, after "kingdom" and "confederation", among other options, were rejected. The term
dominion
was allegedly suggested by Sir Samuel Leonard Tilley.
[
76
]
The delegates had completed their draft of the
British North America Act
by February 1867. The act was presented to Queen Victoria on February 11, 1867. The bill was introduced in the
House of Lords
the next day. The bill was quickly approved by the House of Lords, and then also quickly approved by the
British House of Commons
. (The
Conservative
Lord Derby
was
prime minister of the United Kingdom
at the time.) The act received
royal assent
on March 29, 1867, and set July 1, 1867, as the date for union.

British North America Acts

Main article:
British North America Acts
The proclamation of Canadian Confederation
Confederation was accomplished when the Queen gave royal assent to the
British North America Act
(
BNA Act
) on March 29, 1867, followed by a royal proclamation stating, "we do ordain, declare, and command that, on and after the first day of July, one thousand eight hundred and sixty-seven, the provinces of Canada, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick shall form and be One Dominion, under the name of Canada."
[
78
]
The act replaced the Act of Union 1840, which had unified Upper Canada and Lower Canada into the united Province of Canada; separate provinces were established under their current names of Ontario and Quebec, respectively. July 1 is now celebrated as
Canada Day
, the country's official
national day
.
Confederation is regarded as the creation of a kingdom in its own right
[
82
]
and to have "successfully reconciled the physical absence of a geographically distant monarch with a continuing and pervasive presence through the medium of formal representatives and the manner and forms of legal and conventional rules and behaviour associated with British parliamentary and monarchical governance".

Macdonald had spoken of "founding a great British monarchy" and wanted the newly created country to be called the
Kingdom of Canada
.
[
84
]
The
Colonial Office
opposed the term
kingdom
as "premature" and "pretentious" and felt it might antagonize the United States. The term
dominion
was chosen, instead, to indicate Canada's status as a self-governing polity of the British Empire, the first time it was used in reference to a country.
[
85
]
When the
British North America Act, 1867
, was passed in the Parliament in
Westminster
, the Queen said to Macdonald, "I am very glad to see you on this mission [...] It is a very important measure and you have all exhibited so much loyalty."
[

While the
BNA Act
eventually resulted in Canada having more autonomy than it had before, the country was still far from fully independent of the United Kingdom. Foreign policy remained in British hands, the
Judicial Committee of the Privy Council
remained Canada's highest court of appeal, and the constitution could be amended only in Britain. Gradually, Canada gained more autonomy; defence of British North America became a Canadian responsibility.
[
86
]
According to the Supreme Court of Canada, Canadian "sovereignty was acquired in the period between its separate signature of the Treaty of Versailles in 1919 and the Statute of Westminster, 1931",
[
87
]
which gave the country nearly full independence. It was only because the federal and provincial governments were unable to agree on a formula for amending the constitution that the power to do so remained with the British Parliament. Once that issue was resolved, the constitution was
patriated
when
Elizabeth II
gave royal assent to the
Canada Act, 1982
.
The
constitution of Canada
is made up of a number of codified acts and uncodified conventions; one of the principal documents is the
Constitution Act, 1982
, which renamed the
British North America Act, 1867
, to the
Constitution Act, 1867
.
[
88
]
[
89
]
The act also details how power is distributed in both the provincial and federal jurisdictions. Two of the most important sections are 91 and 92. Section 91 gives Parliament jurisdiction over banking, interest rates, criminal law, the postal system, and the armed forces. Section 92 gives the provinces jurisdiction over property, contracts and torts, local works, and general business. Still, federal and provincial law may occasionally interfere with each other, in which case federal law prevails.

John A. Macdonald became the first
prime minister of Canada
.
Dominion elections were held in August and September, 1867, to elect the first
Parliament
. The governments of the Province of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick nominated the seventy-two individuals who would be named to the
Senate
, who were listed in the
proclamation of Confederation
(twenty-four each for Quebec and Ontario, twelve each for New Brunswick and Nova Scotia). They were called to the Senate by the governor general for the opening of the first Parliament.
[

[

]
The Anti-Confederation Party won 18 out of 19 federal Nova Scotia seats in September 1867, and in the Nova Scotia provincial election of 1868, 36 out of 38 seats in the legislature. For seven years, William Annand and Joseph Howe led the ultimately unsuccessful fight to convince British imperial authorities to release Nova Scotia from Confederation. The government was vocally against Confederation, contending it was no more than the annexation of the province to the pre-existing province of Canada.
[
93
]
Prior to the coming into effect of the
Constitution Act, 1867
, there had been some concern regarding a potential "legislative vacuum" that would occur over the 15-month period between the prorogation of the Province of Canada's final Parliament in August 1866 and the opening of the now Dominion of Canada's first Parliament in November 1867.
[
94
]
To prevent this, the
Constitution Act, 1867
, provided for "continuance of existing laws" from the three colonies of Canada, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick until new laws could be established in the Dominion.
[
95
]
Thus, the "Dominion's financial systems, structures and actors were able to operate under the provisions of the old Province of Canada Acts" following confederation, and many institutions and organizations were continued and assumed "the same responsibilities for the new federal government that it had held as a provincial organization".
[

Joining Confederation
[
edit
]
After the initial
BNA Act
in 1867,
Manitoba
was established by an act of the Canadian Parliament on July 15, 1870, originally as an area of land much smaller than the current province.
[
97
]
British Columbia joined Canada July 20, 1871, by an Imperial order-in-council enacted under the authority of the
British North America Act
.
[
98
]
[
99
]
[
100
]
The order-in-council incorporated the Terms of Union negotiated by the governments of Canada and British Columbia, including a commitment by the federal government to build a railway connecting British Columbia to the railway system of Canada within 10 years of union.
[
101
]
Prince Edward Island (PEI) joined July 1, 1873, also by an Imperial order-in-council.
[
102
]
One reason for joining was financial: PEI's economy was performing poorly and union would bring monetary benefits that would assist the province in avoiding bankruptcy.
[
103
]
One of the Prince Edward Island Terms of Union was a guarantee by the federal government to operate a
ferry
link, a term deleted upon completion of the
Confederation Bridge
in 1997.
[
98
]
Alberta
and
Saskatchewan
were established September 1, 1905, by acts of the Canadian Parliament. Newfoundland joined on March 31, 1949, by an act of the Imperial Parliament, also with a ferry link guaranteed.

The Crown acquired Rupert's Land and the North-Western Territory from the Hudson's Bay Company in 1869 (though final payment to the Hudson's Bay Company did not occur until 1870), and then transferred jurisdiction to the Dominion on July 15, 1870, merging them and naming them
North-West Territories
.
[
105
]
In 1880, the British assigned all
North American Arctic islands
to Canada, right up to
Ellesmere Island
.
[
106
]
From this vast swath of territory were created three provinces (Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta) and two territories (
Yukon Territory
and North-West Territories, now Yukon and Northwest Territories), and two extensions each to Quebec, Ontario, and Manitoba. Later, the third territory of
Nunavut
was carved from the Northwest Territories on April 1, 1999.
[
107
]
The Yukon territory was formed during the Klondike gold rush. People from all around Canada and the United States flocked to the area due to rumours of an easy way to get rich. The Canadian government sought to regulate this migration and tax gold findings, whether American or Canadian.

The term
confederation
has entered into Canadian parlance both as a metaphor for the country and for the historical events that created it. It has therefore become one of the most common names for Canadian landmarks. Examples include
Mount Confederation
,
Confederation Square
, the
Confederation Building
,
Confederation Park
,
Confederation Station
,
Confederation Heights
, Confederation Bridge, and so on. This is similar to the American practices of naming things
union
and likewise the Australians with
federation
.

Indigenous communities were ignored in the process of Canadian confederation.
[
109
]
As a result of Confederation, the Parliament and government of Canada assumed the responsibilities of their British counterparts in treaty dealings with the First Nations. The federal Parliament subsequently passed the
Indian Act
in 1876, which, in amended form, continues to govern Indigenous peoples. Confederation created conditions of colonialism, including resource grabbing, broken treaties, forced assimilation, patriarchy, and intergenerational trauma inflicted by the hegemony of the Canadian state on Indigenous nations that had been self-governing.
[
114
]
As the 20th century progressed, attention to the conditions of Indigenous peoples in Canada increased, which included the granting of full voting rights in 1960. Treaty rights were enshrined in the Canadian constitution in 1982 and,
[
115
]
[
116
]
in
Sparrow v. The Queen
,
[
117
]
the Supreme Court determined there exists a
fiduciary
affiliation between the Canadian Crown and Indigenous peoples
in which the Crown is constitutionally charged with providing certain guarantees to the First Nations.

Recognizing the principle of
