A
geographic coordinate system
(
GCS
) is a
spherical
or
geodetic coordinate
system for measuring and communicating
positions
directly on
Earth
as
latitude
and
longitude
.
[
1
]
It is the simplest, oldest, and most widely used type of the various
spatial reference systems
that are in use, and forms the basis for most others. Although latitude and longitude form a coordinate
tuple
like a
cartesian coordinate system
, the geographic coordinate system is not cartesian because the measurements are angles and are not on a planar surface.
[

]
A full GCS specification, such as those listed in the
EPSG
and ISO 19111 standards, also includes a choice of
geodetic datum
(including an
Earth ellipsoid
), as different datums will yield different latitude and longitude values for the same location.

History

History of geodesy
The
invention
of a geographic coordinate system is generally credited to
Eratosthenes
of
Cyrene
, who composed his now-lost
Geography
at the
Library of Alexandria
in the 3rd century BC.
[
4
]
A century later,
Hipparchus
of
Nicaea
improved on this system by determining latitude from stellar measurements rather than solar altitude and determining longitude by timings of
lunar eclipses
, rather than
dead reckoning
. In the 1st or 2nd century,
Marinus of Tyre
compiled an extensive gazetteer and
mathematically plotted world map
using coordinates measured east from a
prime meridian
at the westernmost known land, designated the
Fortunate Isles
, off the coast of western Africa around the
Canary
or
Cape Verde Islands
, and measured north or south of the island of
Rhodes
off
Asia Minor
.
Ptolemy
credited him with the full adoption of longitude and latitude, rather than measuring latitude in terms of the length of the
midsummer
day.
[
5
]
Ptolemy's 2nd-century
Geography
used the same prime meridian but measured latitude from the
Equator
instead. After their work was translated into
Arabic
in the 9th century,
Al-Khwārizmī
's
Book of the Description of the Earth
corrected Marinus' and Ptolemy's errors regarding the length of the
Mediterranean Sea
,
[
note 1
]
causing
medieval Arabic cartography
to use a prime meridian around 10° east of Ptolemy's line. Mathematical cartography resumed in Europe following
Maximus Planudes
' recovery of Ptolemy's text a little before 1300; the text was translated into
Latin
at
Florence
by
Jacopo d'Angelo
around 1407.
In 1884, the
United States
hosted the
International Meridian Conference
, attended by representatives from twenty-five nations. Twenty-two of them agreed to adopt the longitude of the
Royal Observatory
in
Greenwich
, England as the zero-reference line. The
Dominican Republic
voted against the motion, while France and
Brazil
abstained.
[

France adopted
Greenwich Mean Time
in place of local determinations by the
Paris Observatory
in 1911.

Main articles:
Latitude
and
Longitude
The
latitude
φ
of a point on Earth's surface is defined in one of three ways, depending on the type of coordinate system. In each case, the latitude is the angle formed by the plane of the equator and a line formed by the point on the surface and a second point on equatorial plane. What varies between the types of coordinate systems is how the point on the equatorial plane is determined:
In an astronomical coordinate system, the second point is found where the extension of the
plumb bob
vertical from the surface point intersects the equatorial plane.
In a geodetic coordinate system, the second point is found where the
normal vector
from the surface of the ellipsoid at the surface point intersects the equatorial plane.
In a geocentric coordinate system, the second point is the center of Earth.
The path that joins all points of the same latitude traces a circle on the surface of Earth, as viewed from above the north or south pole, called
parallels
, as they are parallel to the equator and to each other. The
north pole
is 90° N; the
south pole
is 90° S. The 0° parallel of latitude is defined to be the
equator
, the
fundamental plane
of a geographic coordinate system. The equator divides the globe into
Northern
and
Southern Hemispheres
.
The
longitude
λ
of a point on Earth's surface is the angle east or west of a reference
meridian
to another meridian that passes through that point. All meridians are halves of great
ellipses
, which converge at the North and South Poles. The meridian of the British
Royal Observatory
in
Greenwich
, in southeast London, England, is the international
prime meridian
, although some organizations—such as the French
Institut national de l'information géographique et forestière
—continue to use other meridians for internal purposes. The
antipodal
meridian of Greenwich is both 180°W and 180°E. This is not to be conflated with the
International Date Line
, which diverges from it in several places for political and convenience reasons, including between far eastern Russia and the far western
Aleutian Islands
.
The combination of these two components specifies the position of any location on the surface of Earth, without consideration of
altitude
or depth. The visual grid on a map formed by lines of latitude and longitude is known as a
graticule
.

The origin/zero point of this system is located in the
Gulf of Guinea
about 625 km (390 mi) south of
Tema
, Ghana, a location often facetiously called
Null Island
.

In order to use the theoretical definitions of latitude, longitude, and height to precisely measure actual locations on the physical earth, a
geodetic datum
must be used. A
horizonal datum
is used to precisely measure latitude and longitude, while a
vertical datum
is used to measure elevation or altitude. Both types of datum bind a mathematical model of the shape of the earth (usually a
reference ellipsoid
for a horizontal datum, and a more precise
geoid
for a vertical datum) to the earth. Traditionally, this binding was created by a network of
control points
, surveyed locations at which monuments are installed, and were only accurate for a region of the surface of the Earth. Newer datums are based on a global network for satellite measurements (
GNSS
,
VLBI
,
SLR
and
DORIS
).
This combination of a mathematical model and physical binding ensures that users of the same datum obtain identical coordinates for a given physical point. However, different datums typically produce different coordinates for the same location (sometimes deviating several hundred meters) not due to actual movement, but because the reference system itself is shifted. Because any
spatial reference system
or
map projection
is ultimately calculated from latitude and longitude, it is crucial that they clearly state the datum on which they are based. For example, a
UTM
coordinate based on a
WGS84
realisation will be different than a UTM coordinate based on
NAD27
for the same location. Transforming coordinates from one datum to another requires a
datum transformation
method such as a
Helmert transformation
, although in certain situations a simple
translation
may be sufficient.
[
8
]
Datums may be global, meaning that they represent the whole Earth, or they may be regional,
[
9
]
meaning that they represent an ellipsoid best-fit to only a portion of the Earth. Examples of global datums include the several realizations of
WGS 84
(with the 2D datum ensemble EPSG:4326 with 2 meter accuracy as identifier)
[
10
]
[
11
]
used for the
Global Positioning System
,
[
note 2
]
and the several realizations of the
International Terrestrial Reference System and Frame
(such as ITRF2020 with subcentimeter accuracy), which takes into account
continental drift
and
crustal deformation
.
[
12
]
Datums with a regional fit of the ellipsoid that are chosen by a national cartographical organization include the
North American Datums
, the European
ED50
, and the British
OSGB36
. Given a location, the datum provides the latitude
ϕ
{\displaystyle \phi }
and longitude
λ
{\displaystyle \lambda }
. In the United Kingdom there are three common latitude, longitude, and height systems in use. WGS
84 differs at Greenwich from the one used on published maps OSGB36 by approximately 112
m. ED50 differs from about 120
m to 180
m.
[

Points on the Earth's surface move relative to each other due to continental plate motion, subsidence, and diurnal
Earth tidal
movement caused by the
Moon
and the Sun. This daily movement can be as much as a meter. Continental movement can be up to
10 cm
a year, or
10 m
in a century. A
weather system
high-pressure area can cause a sinking of
5 mm
.
Scandinavia
is rising by
1 cm
a year as a result of the melting of the ice sheets of the
last ice age
, but neighboring
Scotland
is rising by only
0.2 cm
. These changes are insignificant if a regional datum is used, but are statistically significant if a global datum is used.

spheroid at

at the Equator, one latitudinal second measures 30.715
m
, one latitudinal minute is 1843 m and one latitudinal degree is 110.6 km. The circles of longitude, meridians, meet at the geographical poles, with the west–east width of a second naturally decreasing as latitude increases. On the
Equator
at sea level, one longitudinal second measures 30.92 m, a longitudinal minute is 1855 m and a longitudinal degree is 111.3 km. At 30° a longitudinal second is 26.76 m, at Greenwich (51°28′38″N) 19.22 m, and at 60° it is 15.42 m.
On the WGS
84 spheroid, the length in meters of a degree of latitude at latitude
ϕ
(that is, the number of meters you would have to travel along a north–south line to move 1 degree in latitude, when at latitude
ϕ
), is about

(Those coefficients can be improved, but as they stand the distance they give is correct within a centimeter.)
The formulae both return units of meters per degree.
An alternative method to estimate the length of a longitudinal degree at latitude

is to assume a spherical Earth (to get the width per minute and second, divide by 60 and 3600, respectively):
π

{\displaystyle {\frac {\pi }{180}}M_{r}\cos \phi \!}
where
Earth's average meridional radius
M

is
6,367,449 m
. Since the Earth is an
oblate spheroid
, not spherical, that result can be off by several tenths of a percent; a better approximation of a longitudinal degree at latitude
ϕ
{\displaystyle \phi }
is
π
180

{\textstyle {\tfrac {b}{a}}=0.99664719}
. (
β
{\displaystyle \textstyle {\beta }\,\!}
is known as the
reduced (or parametric) latitude
). Aside from rounding, this is the exact distance along a parallel of latitude; getting the distance along the shortest route will be more work, but those two distances are always within 0.6 m of each other if the two points are one degree of longitude apart.

Alternative encodings
Like any series of multiple-digit numbers, latitude-longitude pairs can be challenging to communicate and remember. Therefore, alternative schemes have been developed for encoding GCS coordinates into alphanumeric strings or words:
the
Maidenhead Locator System
, popular with radio operators.
the
World Geographic Reference System
(GEOREF), developed for global military operations, replaced by the current
Global Area Reference System
(GARS).
Open Location Code
or "Plus Codes", developed by Google and released into the public domain.
Geohash
, a public domain system based on the Morton
Z-order curve
.
Mapcode
, an open-source system originally developed at TomTom.
What3words
, a proprietary system that encodes GCS coordinates as pseudorandom sets of words by dividing the coordinates into three numbers and looking up words in an indexed dictionary.
These are not distinct coordinate systems, only alternative methods for expressing latitude and longitude measurements.
