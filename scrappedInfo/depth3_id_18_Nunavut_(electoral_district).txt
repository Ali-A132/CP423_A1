Nunavut
is a federal
electoral district
covering the entire territory of
Nunavut
, Canada, that has been represented in the
House of Commons of Canada
since 1979. Before 1997, it was known as
Nunatsiaq
and was one of two electoral districts in the
Northwest Territories
.
The riding is the largest federal electoral district by land area in Canada,
[
2
]
and, since the abolition of the
Division of Kalgoorlie
in Western Australia, it is the second largest electoral district in the world after
Yakutsk
in Russia.
[

]
It is also the world's northernmost single-member constituency, since Greenland elects two members to the Danish
Folketing
and uses proportional representation for its own
Inatsisartut
.

In 1999, the district's boundaries were redefined in the

.
