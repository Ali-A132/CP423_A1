Canada
is a country in
North America
. Its
ten provinces and three territories
extend from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean and northward into the Arctic Ocean, making it the world's
second-largest country by total area
, with the
world's longest coastline
. Its
border with the United States
is the world's longest international land border. The country is characterized by a wide range of both
meteorologic
and
geological
regions. With
a population
of over 41
million people, it has widely varying population densities, with the majority residing in
urban areas
and large areas of the country being sparsely populated. Canada's capital is
Ottawa
and
its three largest metropolitan areas
are
Toronto
,
Montreal
, and
Vancouver
.
Indigenous peoples
have continuously inhabited what is now Canada for thousands of years. Beginning in the 16th century,
British
and
French
expeditions explored and later settled along the Atlantic coast. As a consequence of
various armed conflicts
, France
ceded nearly all
of
its colonies in North America
in 1763. In 1867, with the union of three
British North American
colonies through
Confederation
, Canada was formed as a
federal
dominion
of four provinces. This began an
accretion of provinces and territories
resulting in the
displacement of Indigenous populations
, and a process of increasing autonomy from the United Kingdom. This increased sovereignty was highlighted by the
Statute of Westminster, 1931
, and culminated in the
Canada Act 1982
, which severed the vestiges of legal dependence on the
Parliament of the United Kingdom
.
Canada is a
parliamentary democracy
and a
constitutional monarchy
in the
Westminster tradition
. The country's
head of government
is the
prime minister
, who holds office by virtue of their ability to
command the confidence
of the elected
House of Commons
and is appointed by the
governor general
, representing the
monarch of Canada
, the ceremonial
head of state
. The country is a
Commonwealth realm
and is
officially bilingual
(English and French) in the federal jurisdiction. It is
very highly ranked in international measurements
of government transparency, quality of life, economic competitiveness, innovation, education and human rights. It is one of the world's most
ethnically diverse
and
multicultural
nations, the product of
large-scale immigration
. Canada's long and complex
relationship with the United States
has had a significant impact on
its history
,
economy
, and
culture
.
A
developed country
, Canada has a
high nominal per capita income globally
and its advanced economy ranks among the
largest in the world by nominal GDP
, relying chiefly upon
its abundant natural resources
and well-developed
international trade networks
. Recognized as a
middle power
, Canada's support for
multilateralism
and
internationalism
has been closely related to
its foreign relations policies
of
peacekeeping
and
aid for developing countries
. Canada promotes
its domestically shared values
through participation in
multiple international organizations and forums
.
Etymology
Main article:
Name of Canada
While a variety of theories have been postulated for the etymological origins of
Canada
, the name is now accepted as coming from the
St. Lawrence Iroquoian
word
kanata
, meaning "village" or "settlement".
[
8
]
In 1535, Indigenous inhabitants of the present-day
Quebec City
region used the word to direct French explorer
Jacques Cartier
to the village of
Stadacona
.
[
9
]
Cartier later used the word
Canada
to refer not only to that particular village but to the entire area subject to
Donnacona
(the chief at Stadacona);
[
9
]
by 1545, European books and maps had begun referring to this small region along the
Saint Lawrence River
as
Canada
.
[
9
]
From the 16th to the early 18th century,
Canada
referred to the part of
New France
that lay along the Saint Lawrence River.
[
10
]
Following the British
conquest of New France
, this area was known as the British
Province of Quebec
from 1763 to 1791.
[
11
]
In 1791, the area became two British colonies called
Upper Canada
and
Lower Canada
. These two colonies were collectively referred to as
the Canadas
until their union as the
Province of Canada
in 1841.
[
12
]
Upon
Confederation in 1867
,
Canada
was adopted as the legal name for the new country at the
London Conference
and the word
dominion
was conferred as the country's title.
[
13
]
By the 1950s, the term
Dominion of Canada
was no longer used by the United Kingdom, which considered Canada a "realm of the Commonwealth".
[
14
]
The
Canada Act 1982
, which brought the
Constitution of Canada
fully under Canadian control, referred only to
Canada
. Later that year, the name of the national holiday was changed from Dominion Day to
Canada Day
.

Indigenous peoples
The
first inhabitants of North America
are generally hypothesized to have migrated from
Siberia
by way of the
Bering land bridge
and arrived at least 14,000 years ago.
[
16
]
The
Paleo-Indian
archeological sites at
Old Crow Flats
and
Bluefish Caves
are two of the oldest sites of human habitation in Canada.
[
17
]
The
characteristics of Indigenous societies
included permanent settlements, agriculture, complex societal hierarchies, and trading networks.
[
18
]
Some of these cultures had collapsed by the time European explorers arrived in the late 15th and early 16th centuries and have only been discovered through archeological investigations.
[
19
]
Indigenous peoples in present-day Canada
include the
First Nations
,
Inuit
, and
Métis
,
[
20
]
the last being of
mixed descent
who originated in the mid-17th century when First Nations people married European settlers and their offspring subsequently developed their own identity.
[
20
]
A map of Canada showing the percent of
self-reported indigenous identity
(First Nations, Inuit, Métis) by census division, according to the
2021 Canadian census
[
21
]
The
Indigenous population
at the time of the first European settlements is estimated to have been between 200,000
[
22
]
and two million,
[
23
]
with a figure of 500,000 accepted by Canada's
Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples
.
[
24
]
As a consequence of European colonization, the Indigenous population declined by forty to eighty percent.
[
25
]
The decline is attributed to several causes, including the
transfer of European diseases
, to which they had no natural immunity,
[
26
]
conflicts over the fur trade, conflicts with the colonial authorities and settlers, and the loss of Indigenous lands to settlers and the subsequent collapse of several nations' self-sufficiency.
[
27
]
Although not without conflict,
European Canadians
' early interactions with First Nations and Inuit populations were relatively peaceful.
[
28
]
First Nations and Métis peoples played a critical part in the development of
European colonies in Canada
, particularly for their role in assisting European
coureurs des bois
and
voyageurs
in their explorations of the continent during the
North American fur trade
.
[
29
]
These early European interactions with First Nations would change from
friendship and peace treaties
to the
dispossession of Indigenous lands through treaties
.
[
30
]
From the late 18th century, European Canadians forced Indigenous peoples to assimilate into a western Canadian society.
[
31
]
Settler colonialism
reached a climax in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
[
32
]
A period of redress began with the formation of a
reconciliation commission
by the
Government of Canada
in 2008.
[
33
]
This included acknowledgment of
cultural genocide
,
[
34
]
settlement agreements
,
[
33
]
and betterment of racial discrimination issues, such as addressing the plight of
missing and murdered Indigenous women
.

It is believed that the first documented European to explore the east coast of Canada was
Norse
explorer
Leif Erikson
.
[
37
]
In approximately 1000 AD, the Norse built a small short-lived encampment that was occupied sporadically for perhaps 20 years at
L'Anse aux Meadows
on the northern tip of
Newfoundland
.
[
38
]
No further European exploration occurred until 1497, when seafarer
John Cabot
explored and claimed Canada's
Atlantic coast
in the name of
Henry VII of England
.
[
39
]
In 1534, French explorer Jacques Cartier explored the
Gulf of Saint Lawrence
where, on July 24, he planted a 10-metre (33 ft) cross bearing the words, "long live the King of France", and took possession of the territory New France in the name of
King Francis I
.
[
40
]
The early 16th century saw European mariners with navigational techniques pioneered by the
Basque
and
Portuguese
establish seasonal whaling and fishing outposts along the Atlantic coast.
[
41
]
In general, early settlements during the
Age of Discovery
appear to have been
short-lived
due to a combination of the harsh climate, problems with navigating trade routes and competing outputs in Scandinavia.
[
42
]
In 1583, Sir
Humphrey Gilbert
, by the
royal prerogative
of Queen
Elizabeth I
, founded
St John's, Newfoundland
, as the first North American
English seasonal camp
.
[
43
]
In 1600, the French established their first seasonal trading post at
Tadoussac
along the Saint Lawrence.
[
38
]
French explorer
Samuel de Champlain
arrived in 1603 and established the first permanent year-round European settlements at
Port Royal
(in 1605) and Quebec City (in 1608).
[
44
]
Among the
colonists
of New France,
Canadiens
extensively settled the Saint Lawrence River valley and
Acadians
settled the present-day
Maritimes
, while fur traders and
Catholic missionaries
explored the
Great Lakes
,
Hudson Bay
, and the
Mississippi watershed
to
Louisiana
.
[
45
]
The
Beaver Wars
broke out in the mid-17th century over control of the North American fur trade.
[
46
]
The English established additional settlements in
Newfoundland
in 1610 along with settlements in the
Thirteen Colonies
to the south.
[
47
]
A series of
four wars
erupted in colonial North America between 1689 and 1763; the later wars of the period constituted the North American theatre of the
Seven Years' War
.
[
48
]
Mainland
Nova Scotia
came under British rule with the 1713
Treaty of Utrecht
and Canada and most of New France came under British rule in 1763 after the Seven Years' War.

The
Royal Proclamation of 1763
established First Nation treaty rights, created the
Province of Quebec
out of New France, and annexed
Cape Breton Island
to Nova Scotia.
[
15
]
St John's Island (now
Prince Edward Island
) became a separate colony in 1769.
[
51
]
To avert conflict in
Quebec
, the British Parliament passed the
Quebec Act
1774, expanding Quebec's territory to the Great Lakes and
Ohio Valley
.
[
52
]
More importantly, the Quebec Act afforded Quebec special autonomy and rights of self-administration at a time when the Thirteen Colonies were increasingly agitating against British rule.
[
53
]
It re-established the French language, Catholic faith, and
French civil law
there, staving off the growth of an independence movement in contrast to the Thirteen Colonies.
[
54
]
The Proclamation and the Quebec Act in turn angered many residents of the Thirteen Colonies, further fuelling anti-British sentiment in the years prior to the
American Revolution
.
[
15
]
After the successful American War of Independence, the
1783 Treaty of Paris
recognized the independence of the newly formed
United States
and set the terms of peace, ceding
British North American
territories south of the Great Lakes and east of the Mississippi River to the new country.
[
55
]
The American war of independence also caused a large out-migration of
Loyalists
, the settlers who had fought against American independence. Many moved to Canada, particularly Atlantic Canada, where their arrival changed the demographic distribution of the existing territories.
New Brunswick
was in turn split from Nova Scotia as part of a reorganization of Loyalist settlements in the Maritimes, which led to the incorporation of
Saint John, New Brunswick
, as Canada's first city.
[
56
]
To accommodate the influx of English-speaking Loyalists in Central Canada, the
Constitutional Act of 1791
divided the province of Canada into French-speaking Lower Canada (later
Quebec
) and English-speaking Upper Canada (later
Ontario
), granting each its own elected legislative assembly.

The Canadas were the main front in the
War of 1812
between the United States and the
United Kingdom
. Peace came in 1815; no boundaries were changed.
[
59
]
Immigration resumed at a higher level, with over 960,000 arrivals from Britain between 1815 and 1850.
[
60
]
New arrivals included refugees escaping the
Great Irish Famine
as well as
Gaelic
-speaking Scots displaced by the
Highland Clearances
.
[
61
]
Infectious diseases killed between 25 and 33 percent of Europeans who immigrated to Canada before 1891.
[
22
]
The desire for
responsible government
resulted in the abortive
Rebellions of 1837
.
[
62
]
The
Durham Report
subsequently recommended responsible government and the assimilation of French Canadians into English culture.
[
15
]
The
Act of Union 1840
merged the Canadas into a united Province of Canada and responsible government was established for all provinces of British North America east of Lake Superior by 1855.
[
63
]
The signing of the
Oregon Treaty
by Britain and the United States in 1846 ended the
Oregon boundary dispute
, extending the border westward along the
49th parallel
. This paved the way for British colonies on
Vancouver Island (1849)
and in
British Columbia (1858)
.
[
64
]
The Anglo-Russian
Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1825)
established the border along the Pacific coast, but, even after the US
Alaska Purchase
of 1867, disputes continued about the exact demarcation of the Alaska–Yukon and Alaska–British Columbia border.
[
65
]
Confederation and expansion
Animated map showing
the growth and change of Canada's provinces and territories

[
66
]
Following three constitutional conferences, the
British North America Act, 1867
officially proclaimed Canadian Confederation on July 1, 1867, initially with four provinces:
Ontario
, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick.
[
67
]
Canada assumed control of
Rupert's Land
and the
North-Western Territory
to form the
Northwest Territories
, where the Métis' grievances ignited the
Red River Rebellion
and the creation of the province of
Manitoba
in July 1870.
[
68
]
British Columbia and Vancouver Island (which
had been united
in 1866) joined the confederation in 1871 on the promise of a transcontinental railway extending to Victoria in the province within 10 years,
[
69
]
while Prince Edward Island joined in 1873.
[
70
]
In 1898, during the
Klondike Gold Rush
in the Northwest Territories, Parliament created the Yukon Territory.
Alberta
and
Saskatchewan
became provinces in 1905.
[
70
]
Between 1871 and 1896, almost one quarter of the Canadian population emigrated south to the US.
[
71
]
To open
the West
and encourage European immigration, the Government of Canada sponsored the construction of three transcontinental railways (including the
Canadian Pacific Railway
), passed the
Dominion Lands Act
to regulate settlement and established the
North-West Mounted Police
to assert authority over the territory.
[
72
]
This
period of westward expansion
and
nation building
resulted in the displacement of many
Indigenous peoples of the Canadian Prairies
to "
Indian reserves
",
[
73
]
clearing the way for ethnic European
block settlements
.
[
74
]
This caused the collapse of the
Plains Bison in western Canada
and the introduction of European
cattle farms and wheat fields
dominating the land.
[
75
]
The Indigenous peoples saw widespread famine and disease due to the loss of the bison and their traditional hunting lands.
[
76
]
The federal government did provide emergency relief, on condition of the Indigenous peoples moving to the reserves.
[
77
]
During this time, Canada introduced the
Indian Act
extending its control over the First Nations to education, government and legal rights.

Because Britain still maintained control of Canada's foreign affairs under the British North America Act, 1867, its declaration of war in 1914 automatically brought
Canada into the First World War
.
[
79
]
Volunteers sent to the
Western Front
later became part of the
Canadian Corps
, which played a substantial role in the
Battle of Vimy Ridge
and other major engagements of the war.
[
80
]
The
Conscription Crisis of 1917
erupted when the
Unionist
Cabinet's proposal to augment the military's dwindling number of active members with
conscription
was met with vehement objections from French-speaking Quebecers.
[
81
]
In 1919, Canada joined the
League of Nations
independently of Britain,
[
80
]
and the
Statute of Westminster, 1931
, affirmed Canada's independence.
[
82
]
The
Great Depression in Canada
during the early 1930s saw an economic downturn, leading to hardship across the country.
[
83
]
In response to the downturn, the
Co-operative Commonwealth Federation
(CCF) in Saskatchewan introduced many elements of a
welfare state
(as pioneered by
Tommy Douglas
) in the 1940s and 1950s.
[
84
]
On the advice of Prime Minister
William Lyon Mackenzie King
,
war with Germany was declared
effective September 10, 1939, by King
George VI
, seven days after the United Kingdom. The delay underscored Canada's independence.
[
80
]
The first Canadian Army units arrived in Britain in December 1939. In all, over a million Canadians served in the armed forces during the
Second World War
.
[
85
]
Canadian troops played important roles in many key battles of the war, including the failed 1942
Dieppe Raid
, the
Allied invasion of Italy
, the
Normandy landings
, the
Battle of Normandy
, and the
Battle of the Scheldt
in 1944.
[
80
]
Canada provided asylum for the
Dutch monarchy
while that country was
occupied
and is credited by the Netherlands for major contributions to
its liberation
from
Nazi Germany
.
[
86
]
Despite another
conscription crisis in Quebec in 1944
, Canada finished the war with a large army and strong economy.
[
87
]
Contemporary era
The financial crisis of the Great Depression led the
Dominion of Newfoundland
to relinquish responsible government in 1934 and become a
Crown colony
ruled by a British governor.
[
88
]
After two
referendums
, Newfoundlanders voted to join Canada in 1949 as a province.
[
89
]
Canada's post-war economic growth, combined with the policies of successive Liberal governments, led to the emergence of a new
Canadian identity
, marked by the adoption of the
maple leaf flag
in 1965,
[
90
]
the implementation of
official bilingualism
(English and French) in 1969,
[
91
]
and the institution of
official multiculturalism
in 1971.
[
92
]
Socially democratic
programs were also instituted, such as
Medicare
, the
Canada Pension Plan
, and
Canada Student Loans
; though, provincial governments, particularly Quebec and Alberta, opposed many of these as incursions into their jurisdictions.
[
93
]
A copy of the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
[
94
]
Finally, another series of constitutional conferences resulted in the
Canada Act 1982
, the
patriation
of Canada's constitution from the United Kingdom, concurrent with the creation of the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
.
[
95
]
Canada had established complete sovereignty as an independent country under
its own monarchy
.
[
96
]
In 1999,
Nunavut
became Canada's third territory after a series of negotiations with the federal government.
[
97
]
At the same time, Quebec underwent profound social and economic changes through the
Quiet Revolution
of the 1960s, giving birth to a secular
nationalist
movement.
[
98
]
The radical
Front de libération du Québec
(FLQ) ignited the
October Crisis
with a series of bombings and kidnappings in 1970,
[
99
]
and the
sovereigntist
Parti Québécois
was elected in 1976, organizing an
unsuccessful referendum
on sovereignty-association in 1980. Attempts to accommodate Quebec nationalism constitutionally through the
Meech Lake Accord
failed in 1990.
[
100
]
This led to the formation of the
Bloc Québécois
in Quebec and the invigoration of the
Reform Party of Canada
in the West.
[
101
]
A
second referendum
followed in 1995, in which sovereignty was rejected by a slimmer margin of 50.6 to 49.4 percent.
[
102
]
In 1997, the
Supreme Court
ruled
unilateral secession
by a province would be unconstitutional, and the
Clarity Act
was passed by Parliament, outlining the terms of a negotiated departure from Confederation.
[
100
]
In addition to the issues of Quebec sovereignty, a number of crises shook Canadian society in the late 1980s and early 1990s. These included the explosion of
Air India Flight 182
in 1985, the largest mass murder in Canadian history;
[
103
]
the
École Polytechnique massacre
in 1989, a
university shooting
targeting female students;
[
104
]
and the
Oka Crisis
of 1990,
[
105
]
the first of a number of violent confrontations between provincial governments and Indigenous groups.
[
106
]
Canada joined the
Gulf War
in 1990 and was active in
several peacekeeping missions
in the 1990s, including operations in the
Balkans
during and after the
Yugoslav Wars
,
[
107
]
and in
Somalia
, resulting in an incident that has been described as "
the darkest era in the history of the Canadian military
".
[
108
]
Canada sent
troops to Afghanistan in 2001
, resulting in the largest amount of
Canadian deaths
for any single military mission since the
Korean War
in the early 1950s.
[
109
]
In 2011, Canadian forces participated in the
NATO
-led intervention into the
Libyan Civil War
[
110
]

Köppen climate classification types of Canada
Average winter and summer high
temperatures across Canada
vary from region to region. Winters can be harsh in many parts of the country, particularly in the interior and Prairie provinces, which experience a
continental climate
, where daily average temperatures are near −15
°C
(5
°F
), but can drop below −40 °C (−40 °F) with severe
wind chills
.
[
128
]
In non-coastal regions, snow can cover the ground for almost six months of the year, while in parts of the north snow can persist year-round. Coastal British Columbia has a temperate climate, with a mild and rainy winter. On the east and west coasts, average high temperatures are generally in the low 20s °C (70s °F), while between the coasts, the average summer high temperature ranges from 25 to 30 °C (77 to 86 °F), with temperatures in some interior locations occasionally exceeding 40 °C (104 °F).
[

Much of
Northern Canada
is covered by ice and
permafrost
. The future of the permafrost is uncertain because the Arctic has been warming at three times the global average as a result of
climate change in Canada
.
[

Canada's annual average temperature over land has risen by 1.7 °C (3.1 °F), with changes ranging from 1.1 to 2.3 °C (2.0 to 4.1 °F) in various regions, since 1948.
[
118

The rate of warming has been higher across the North and in the Prairies.
[
131
]
In the southern regions of Canada,
air pollution from both Canada
and the United States—caused by metal smelting, burning coal to power utilities, and vehicle emissions—has resulted in
acid rain
, which has severely impacted waterways, forest growth, and agricultural productivity.

with a tradition of
liberalism
,
[
150
]
and an
egalitarian
,
[

moderate
political ideology.
[
152
]
An emphasis on
social justice
has been a distinguishing element of Canada's political culture.
[
153
]
Peace, order, and good government
, alongside an
Implied Bill of Rights
, are founding principles of
Canadian federalism
.
[
154
]
At the federal level, Canada has been dominated by two relatively
centrist
parties practising "brokerage politics":
[
b
]
the
centre-left
leaning
Liberal Party of Canada
[
157
]
and the
centre-right
leaning
Conservative Party of Canada
(or its
predecessors
).
[
158
]
The historically predominant Liberals position themselves at the centre of the political scale.
[
158
]
Five parties had representatives elected to Parliament in the
2025 election
—the Liberals, who formed a minority government; the Conservatives, who became the
Official Opposition
; the
Bloc Québécois
; the
New Democratic Party
(occupying the
left
[
159
]
); and the
Green Party
.
[
160
]
Far-right
and
far-left
politics have never been a prominent force in Canadian society.
[
161
]
Canada has a
parliamentary system
within the context of a
constitutional monarchy
—the
monarchy of Canada
being the foundation of the executive,
legislative
, and
judicial
branches.
[
162
]
The
reigning
monarch is also monarch of
14 other sovereign Commonwealth countries
[
163
]
and
Canada's 10 provinces
. The monarch appoints a representative, the
governor general
, on the
advice
of the
prime minister
, to carry out most of their ceremonial royal duties.

The monarchy is the source of
sovereignty
and authority in Canada.
[
165
]
However, while the governor general or monarch may exercise their power without ministerial
advice
in rare
crisis situations
,
[
166
]
the use of the executive powers (or
royal prerogative
) is otherwise directed by the
Cabinet
, a committee of
ministers of the Crown
responsible to the elected
House of Commons
and chosen and headed by the prime minister,
[
167
]
the
head of government
. To ensure the stability of government, the governor general will usually appoint as prime minister the person who is the current leader of the political party that can obtain the confidence of a
majority
of members in the House.
[
168
]
The
Prime Minister's Office
(PMO) is one of the most powerful institutions in government, initiating most legislation for parliamentary approval and selecting for appointment by the Crown the governor general,
lieutenant governors
, senators, federal court judges, and heads of
Crown corporations
and government agencies.
[
166
]
The leader of the party with the second-most seats usually becomes the
leader of the Official Opposition
and is part of an adversarial parliamentary system intended to keep the government in check.
[
169
]
The
House of Commons
in its temporary location, the
West Block
[
170
]
The
Parliament of Canada
passes all federal statute laws. It comprises the monarch, the House of Commons, and the
Senate
. While Canada inherited the British concept of
parliamentary supremacy
, this was later, with the enactment of the Constitution Act, 1982, all but completely superseded by the American notion of
the supremacy of the law
.
[
171
]
Each of the 343
members of Parliament
in the House of Commons is elected by simple plurality in an
electoral district
or riding. The
Constitution Act, 1982
, requires that no more than five years pass between elections, although the
Canada Elections Act
limits this to four years with a "fixed" election date in October;
general elections
still must be called by the governor general and can be triggered by either the advice of the prime minister or a lost
confidence vote
in the House.
[
172
]
The 105 members of the Senate, whose seats are apportioned on a regional basis, serve until age 75.
[
173
]
Canadian federalism
divides government responsibilities between the federal government and the 10 provinces.
Provincial legislatures
are
unicameral
and operate in parliamentary fashion similar to the House of Commons.
[
174
]
Canada's three territories also have legislatures, but these are not sovereign, have fewer constitutional responsibilities than the provinces,
[
175
]
and differ structurally from their provincial counterparts.
[
176
]
Law
Main article:
Law of Canada
The
Constitution of Canada
is the supreme law of the country and consists of written text and unwritten conventions.
[
177
]
The
Constitution Act, 1867
(known as the
British North America Act, 1867
prior to 1982), affirmed governance based on parliamentary precedent and divided powers between the federal and provincial governments.
[
178
]
The
Statute of Westminster, 1931
, granted full autonomy, and the
Constitution Act, 1982
, ended all legislative ties to Britain, as well as adding a constitutional amending formula and the
Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
.
[
179
]
The
Charter
guarantees basic
rights and freedoms
that usually cannot be overridden by any government; a
notwithstanding clause
allows Parliament and the provincial legislatures to override certain sections of the
Charter
for a period of five years.
[
180
]
The
Supreme Court of Canada
in Ottawa, west of Parliament Hill
Canada's judiciary
interprets laws and has the power to strike down acts of Parliament that violate the constitution. The
Supreme Court of Canada
is the highest court, final arbiter, and has been led since 2017 by
Richard Wagner
, the
Chief Justice of Canada
.
[
181
]
The governor general appoints the court's nine members on the advice of the prime minister and
minister of justice
.
[
182
]
The federal Cabinet also appoints justices to superior courts in the provincial and territorial jurisdictions.
[
183
]
Common law
prevails everywhere except
Quebec, where civil law
predominates.
[
184
]
Criminal law
is solely a federal responsibility and is uniform throughout Canada.
[
185
]
Law enforcement, including criminal courts, is officially a provincial responsibility, conducted by provincial and municipal police forces.
[
186
]
In most rural and some urban areas, policing responsibilities are contracted to the federal
Royal Canadian Mounted Police
.
[
187
]
Canadian Aboriginal law
provides certain
constitutionally recognized rights to land
and traditional practices for Indigenous groups in Canada.
[
188
]
Various treaties and case laws were established to mediate relations between Europeans and many Indigenous peoples.
[
189
]
The role of Aboriginal law and the rights they support were reaffirmed by
section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982
.
[
189

These rights may include provision of services, such as healthcare through the
Indian Health Transfer Policy
, and exemption from taxation.

Provinces and territories

Political map of Canada showing its
10 provinces and 3 territories
[

Canada is a federation composed of 10
federated states
, called provinces, and three
federal territories
. These may be grouped into
four main regions
:
Western Canada
,
Central Canada
,
Atlantic Canada
, and
Northern Canada
(
Eastern Canada
refers to Central Canada and Atlantic Canada together).
[
192
]
Provinces and territories have responsibility for social programs such as
healthcare
,
education
, and
social programs
,
[
193
]
as well as administration of justice (but not criminal law). Although the provinces collect more revenue than the federal government,
equalization payments
are made by the federal government to ensure reasonably uniform standards of services and taxation are kept between the richer and poorer provinces.
[
194
]
The major difference between a Canadian province and a territory is that provinces receive their sovereignty from the Crown
[
195
]
and power and authority from the
Constitution Act, 1867
, whereas territorial governments have powers delegated to them by the
Parliament of Canada
[
196
]
and the commissioners represent the
King in his federal Council
,
[
197
]
rather than the monarch directly. The powers flowing from the
Constitution Act, 1867
, are divided between the federal government and the provincial governments to exercise exclusively
[
198
]
and any changes to that arrangement require a
constitutional amendment
, while changes to the roles and powers of the territories may be performed unilaterally by the Parliament of Canada.

Canada's role in developing
peacekeeping

Peacekeeping is deeply embedded in Canadian culture and a distinguishing feature that Canadians feel sets their foreign policy apart from the United States.

Canada has long been reluctant to participate in military operations that are not sanctioned by the United Nations,
[

such as the
Vietnam War
or the
2003 invasion of Iraq
.
[
221
]
Since the 21st century, Canadian direct participation in UN peacekeeping efforts has greatly declined.
[
222
]
The large decrease was a result of Canada directing its participation to UN-sanctioned military
operations through the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
, rather than directly through the UN.
[

The change to participation via NATO has resulted in a shift towards more militarized and deadly missions rather than traditional peacekeeping duties.

Canada's official bilingualism policies
give citizens the right to receive federal government services in either English or French with official-
language minorities
guaranteed their own schools in all provinces and territories.

minority constituting 33 percent of the population.
[
309

There are also clusters of Acadians in southwestern Nova Scotia, on Cape Breton Island, and in central and western Prince Edward Island.
[
310
]
Other provinces have no official languages as such, but French is used as a language of instruction, in courts, and for other government services, in addition to English. Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec allow for both English and French to be spoken in the provincial legislatures and laws are enacted in both languages. In Ontario, French has some legal status, but is not fully co-official.

Freedom of religion in Canada
is a constitutionally protected right.
[

Rates of religious adherence have steadily decreased since the 1970s.
[
319

With Christianity in decline after having once been central and integral to Canadian culture and daily life,
[

Although the majority of Canadians consider
religion to be unimportant
in their daily lives,
[

Health
Main article:
Healthcare in Canada
Healthcare in Canada is delivered through the provincial and territorial systems of
publicly funded health care
, informally called
Medicare
.
[
332
]
It is guided by the provisions of the
Canada Health Act
of 1984
[
333
]
and is
universal
.
[
334
]
Universal access to publicly funded health services "is often considered by Canadians as a fundamental value that ensures national healthcare insurance for everyone wherever they live in the country".
[
335
]
Around 30 percent of Canadians' healthcare is paid for through the private sector.
[
336
]
This mostly pays for services not covered or partially covered by Medicare, such as
prescription drugs
,
dentistry
and
optometry
.
[
336

Approximately 65 to 75 percent of Canadians have some form of supplementary health insurance; many receive it through their employers or access secondary social service programs.
[

Health expenditure and financing by country
. Total health expenditure per capita in US dollars (PPP).
In common with many other developed countries, Canada is experiencing an increase in healthcare expenditures due to a
demographic shift
toward an older population, with more retirees and fewer people of working age. In 2021, the average age in Canada was 41.9 years.
[
289
]
Life expectancy is 81.1 years.
[
338
]
A 2016 report by the
chief public health officer
found that 88 percent of Canadians, one of the highest proportions of the population among G7 countries, indicated that they "had good or very good health".
[
339
]
Eighty percent of Canadian adults self-report having at least one major risk factor for chronic disease: smoking, physical inactivity, unhealthy eating or excessive alcohol use.

Canada has one of the highest rates of adult obesity among
OECD
countries, contributing to approximately 2.7 million cases of
diabetes

Four chronic diseases—
cancer
(leading cause of death),
cardiovascular diseases

There are approximately 8
million people aged 15 and older with one or more
disabilities in Canada

In 2021, the
Canadian Institute for Health Information
reported that healthcare spending reached $308
billion, or 12.7 percent of Canada's GDP for that year.
[
343
]
In 2022, Canada's per-capita spending on health expenditures ranked 12th among
health-care systems in the OECD
.
[
344
]
Canada has performed close to, or above the average on the majority of OECD health indicators since the early 2000s, ranking above the average on OECD indicators for wait-times and access to care, with average scores for quality of care and use of resources.
[
345
]
The
Commonwealth Fund's
2021 report comparing the healthcare systems of the 11 most
developed countries
ranked Canada second-to-last.
[
346
]
Identified weaknesses were comparatively higher infant mortality rate, the prevalence of chronic conditions, long wait times, poor availability of after-hours care, and a lack of prescription drugs and dental coverage.
[
346

Monument to Multiculturalism
by Francesco Pirelli, in Toronto
[
365
]
Historically, Canada has been influenced by
British
,
French
, and Indigenous cultures and traditions.
[
366
]
During the 20th century, Canadians with African, Caribbean, and Asian nationalities have added to the
Canadian identity
and its culture.
[
367
]
Canada's culture draws influences from its broad range of constituent nationalities, and policies that promote a
just society
are constitutionally protected.
[
368
]
Since the 1960s, Canada has emphasized
human rights
and inclusiveness for all its people.
[
369
]
The official state policy of multiculturalism
is often cited as one of Canada's significant accomplishments
[
370
]
and a key distinguishing element of Canadian identity.
[
371
]
In Quebec, cultural identity is strong and there is a
French Canadian culture
that is distinct from English Canadian culture.
[
372
]
As a whole, Canada is in theory a
cultural mosaic
of regional ethnic subcultures.
[
373
]
Canada's approach to governance emphasizing multiculturalism, which is based on selective
immigration
,
social integration
, and
suppression
of far-right politics, has wide public support.
[
374
]
Government policies such as publicly funded health care,
higher taxation
to redistribute wealth, the
outlawing of capital punishment
, strong efforts to
eliminate poverty
,
strict gun control
, a
social liberal
attitude toward
women's rights
(like
pregnancy termination
) and
LGBT rights
, and legalized
euthanasia
and
cannabis use
are indicators of Canada's political and cultural values.
[

Canadians also identify with the country's foreign aid policies, peacekeeping roles, the
national park system
, and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

The Arms of Canada are closely modelled after
those of the United Kingdom

This progressed into three major themes of historical Canadian literature: nature, frontier life, and Canada's position within the world, all of which tie into the
garrison mentality
.
[

Canada has a well-developed media sector, but its cultural output—particularly in
English films
,
television shows
, and
magazines
—is often overshadowed by imports from the United States.
[
399
]
As a result, the preservation of a distinctly Canadian culture is supported by federal government programs, laws, and institutions such as the
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation
(CBC), the
National Film Board of Canada
(NFB), and the
Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission
(CRTC).
[

]
Canadian mass media
, both
print
and
digital
, and in both official languages, is largely dominated by a "
handful of corporations
".
[
401
]
The largest of these corporations is the country's national
public broadcaster
, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, which also plays a significant role in producing domestic cultural content, operating
its own radio
and
TV
networks in both English and French.
[
402
]
In addition to the CBC, some provincial governments offer their own public educational TV broadcast services as well, such as
TVOntario
and
Télé-Québec
.
[
403
]
Non-news media content in Canada, including film and television, is influenced both by local creators as well as by imports from the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and France.
[
404
]
In an effort to reduce the amount of foreign-made media, government interventions in television broadcasting can include both regulation of content and public financing.
[
405

Canadian tax laws
limit foreign competition in magazine advertising.

Art in Canada is marked by thousands of years of habitation by Indigenous peoples,
