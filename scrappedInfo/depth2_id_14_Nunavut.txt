Nunavut
[
a
]
is the largest and northernmost
territory
of
Canada
. It was separated officially from the
Northwest Territories
on April 1, 1999, via the
Nunavut Act
[
12
]
and the
Nunavut Land Claims Agreement Act
,
[
13
]
which provided this territory to the
Inuit
for self-government. The boundaries had been drawn in 1993. The creation of Nunavut resulted in the
first major change to Canada's political map
in half a century since the province of
Newfoundland
(now Newfoundland and Labrador) was admitted in 1949.
Nunavut comprises a major portion of
Northern Canada
and most of the
Arctic Archipelago
. Its vast territory makes it the
fifth-largest country subdivision in the world
, as well as North America's second-largest (after
Greenland
). The capital
Iqaluit
(formerly "Frobisher Bay"), on
Baffin Island
in the east, was chosen by a
capital plebiscite in 1995
. Other major communities include the regional centres of
Rankin Inlet
and
Cambridge Bay
.
Nunavut includes
Ellesmere Island
in the far north, the eastern and southern portions of
Victoria Island
in the west, and all islands in Hudson, James and Ungava bays, including the western portion of
Killiniq Island
in the southeast and
Akimiski Island
far to the south of the rest of the territory. It is Canada's only geopolitical region that is not connected to the rest of North America via the
Pan-American Highway
.
[
14
]
Nunavut is the least densely populated major country sub-division in the world (not considering Antarctica), being even less densely populated than Denmark's
Greenland
. With a population of 36,858 as of the
2021 Canadian census
(up from 35,944 in 2016) consisting mostly of Inuit, and a land mass
almost as large as Mexico
, Nunavut's land area of 1,836,993.78 km
2
(709,267.26 sq mi)
[
2
]
has a population density of
0.022/km
2
(0.056/sq mi).
Nunavut is also home to the world's
northernmost
continuously inhabited place,
Alert
.

Early history
[

Map showing
Thule
migration and
Dorset
decline
The region which is now mainland Nunavut was first populated approximately 4,500 years ago by the
Pre-Dorset
, a diverse
Paleo-Eskimo
culture that migrated eastward from the
Bering Strait
region.
[
17
]
The Pre-Dorset culture was succeeded by the
Dorset culture
about 2,800 years ago.
[
18
]
Anthropologists and historians believe that the Dorset culture developed from the Pre-Dorset somehow.
[
18
]
Helluland
, which Norse explorers described visiting in their
Sagas of Icelanders
, has been associated with Nunavut's
Baffin Island
. Claims of contact between the Dorset and Norse are controversial.
[
19
]
[
20
]
The
Thule people
, ancestors of the modern
Inuit
, began migrating from Alaska in the 11th century into the
Northwest Territories
and Nunavut. By 1300, the geographic extent of Thule settlement included most of modern Nunavut.
The migration of the Thule people coincides with the decline of the Dorset.
[
21
]
Thule people genetically and culturally completely replaced Dorset some time after 1300.

European exploration
[
edit
]
Depiction of an Inuit settlement on
Boothia Peninsula
in the 1830s, during
John Ross
' second expedition to find the
Northwest Passage
The earliest written historical account of the area is dated to 1576, an account by English explorer
Martin Frobisher
. While leading an expedition to find the
Northwest Passage
, Frobisher thought he had discovered gold ore around the body of water now known as
Frobisher Bay
on the coast of
Baffin Island
.
[
23
]
The ore turned out to be worthless, but Frobisher made the first recorded European contact with the Inuit. Other explorers in search of the elusive Northwest Passage followed in the 17th century, including
Henry Hudson
,
William Baffin
and
Robert Bylot
.
20th and 21st centuries

Cornwallis
and
Ellesmere Islands
featured in the history of the
Cold War
in the 1950s. Concerned about the area's strategic geopolitical position, the federal government, as part of the
High Arctic relocation
, relocated Inuit from
Nunavik
(northern
Quebec
) to
Resolute
and
Grise Fiord
. In the unfamiliar and hostile conditions, they faced starvation
[
24
]
but were forced to stay.
[
25
]
Forty years later, the
Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples
issued a 1994 report titled
The High Arctic Relocation: A Report on the 1953–55 Relocation
.
[
26
]
The government paid compensation to those affected and their descendants.
On August 18, 2010, in Inukjuak, the Honourable
John Duncan
, PC,
MP
, previously
Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development
and
Federal Interlocutor for Métis and Non-Status Indians
, formally apologized on behalf of the
Government of Canada
for the High Arctic relocation.
[
27
]
[
28
]
Discussions on dividing the
Northwest Territories
along ethnic lines began in the 1950s, and legislation to achieve this was introduced in 1963. After its failure, a federal commission recommended against such a measure.
[
29
]
During the 1970s, activism increased among the Inuit,
First Nations
, and
Innu
peoples for
recognition
of their
forced assimilation
. In 1976, as part of the land claims negotiations between the
Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami
(then called the "Inuit Tapirisat of Canada") and the federal government, the parties discussed division of the Northwest Territories to provide a separate territory for the Inuit. On April 14, 1982, a
plebiscite on division
was held throughout the Northwest Territories. A majority of the residents voted in favour and the federal government gave a conditional agreement seven months later.
[
30
]
A ceremony commemorating the establishment of Nunavut, April 1999
The land claims agreement was completed in September 1992 and ratified by nearly 85% of the voters in Nunavut in
a referendum
. On July 9, 1993, the
Nunavut Land Claims Agreement Act
[
13
]
and the
Nunavut Act
[
12
]
were passed by the
Canadian Parliament
. The transition to establish Nunavut Territory was completed on April 1, 1999.
[
31
]
In 2020, Nunavut imposed strict travel regulations in order to prevent an outbreak of the
COVID-19
pandemic. The government barred entry to almost all non-residents.
[
32
]
On November 6, 2020, Nunavut confirmed its first case in
Sanikiluaq
, having previously been the only place in North America to have had no cases of COVID-19.

of water in Northern Canada. The territory includes a substantial part of the mainland, most of the Arctic Archipelago, and the waters and islands of
Hudson Bay
,
James Bay
, and
Ungava Bay
; this includes the distant
Belcher Islands
and
Akimiski Island
, which were part of the
Northwest Territories
from which Nunavut was separated. This makes it the fifth-largest subnational entity (or
administrative division
) in the world. If Nunavut were a country, it would rank 15th in area.
[
35
]
Nunavut has long land borders with the Northwest Territories on the mainland and a few Arctic islands, and with
Manitoba
to the south of the Nunavut mainland; it also meets
Saskatchewan
to the southwest at a
quadripoint
, and has a short land border with
Newfoundland and Labrador
on
Killiniq Island
. The boundary with the Northwest Territories roughly approximates the
tree line
in Canada.
[
36
]
Nunavut shares maritime borders with the provinces of Quebec, Ontario, and Manitoba; these run along the shoreline of those provinces to include the entirety of the involved bays under Nunavut jurisdiction, rather than the usual arrangement of running through the middle of a body of water.
[
37
]
With Greenland, a constituent country of the
Danish Realm
, it shares a primarily maritime international border that includes a short land border on
Hans Island
.
Nunavut's highest point is
Barbeau Peak
(2,616 m (8,583 ft)) on Ellesmere Island. The population density is
0.022/km
2
(0.056/sq mi), one of the lowest in the world. By comparison, Greenland has approximately the same area and nearly twice the population.
[

Climate
[
edit
]
Köppen climate types
in Nunavut
Nunavut experiences a
polar climate
in most regions, owing to its high latitude and lower continental summertime influence than areas to the west. In more southerly continental areas, very cold
subarctic climates
can be found, due to July being slightly milder than the required 10 °C (50 °F).

The population growth rate of Nunavut has been well above the Canadian average for several decades, mostly due to birth rates significantly higher than the Canadian average—a trend that continues. Between 2011 and 2016, Nunavut had the highest population growth rate of any Canadian province or territory, at a rate of 12.7%.
[
61
]
The second-highest was Alberta, with a growth rate of 11.6%. Between 2016 and 2021, the population growth increased by 2.5% (the third lowest), a decrease of 10.2 percentiles from the previous census.

In his 2000 commissioned report (
Aajiiqatigiingniq
Language of Instruction Research Paper
) to the Nunavut Department of Education, Ian Martin of
York University
said that a "long-term threat to
Inuit languages
from English is found everywhere, and current school language policies and practices on language are contributing to that threat" if Nunavut schools follow the Northwest Territories model. He provided a 20-year language plan to create a "fully functional bilingual society, in Inuktitut and English" by 2020.
[

The plan provided different models, including:
"Qulliq Model", for most Nunavut communities, with Inuktitut to be the main language of instruction.
"Inuinnaqtun Immersion Model", for language reclamation and immersion to revitalize Inuinnaqtun as a living language.
"Mixed Population Model", mainly for Iqaluit (possibly for Rankin Inlet), where the population is 40%
Qallunaat
, or non-Inuit, and may have different requirements.

Tourism in Nunavut
In the second half of 2018 travellers visited Nunavut 134,000 times and spent $436 million. Two-thirds of those visits were by Nunavummiut (residents of Nunavut) travelling within the territory. The remaining came from outside other provinces or territories in Canada, or from abroad and spent $219 million. Travellers from Ontario make up the largest portion of visitors from outside the territory. The majority of visitors from outside of Nunavut are business travellers; in the second half of 2018 only 14% of visitors were in the territory for leisure.

Government and politics
[
edit

The
commissioner of Nunavut
is appointed by the Governor-in-Council, consisting of the
governor general of Canada
and the
federal Cabinet
.
[
94
]
[
95
]
As in the other territories, the commissioner's role is symbolic and is analogous to that of a
lieutenant-governor
.
[
96
]
While the
commissioner
is not a representative of the
Canadian monarch
, a role roughly analogous to representing
the Crown
has accrued to the position.
Nunavut elects a single member of the
House of Commons of Canada
. This makes Nunavut the second largest electoral district in the world by area after
Greenland
.

Legislative Assembly of Nunavut
are elected individually; there are

and the legislature is
consensus-based
.
[
97
]
The head of government, the
premier of Nunavut
, is elected by and from the members of the legislative assembly. The
executive council
, which includes the premier and eight ministers, is also elected by the Legislative Assembly from among the Assembly members. On June 14, 2018,
Joe Savikataaq
was elected as the premier, after his predecessor
Paul Quassa
lost a non-confidence motion.
[
98
]
[
99
]
Former
premier
Paul Okalik
set up an advisory council of eleven elders, whose function it is to help incorporate
"
Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit
"
(Inuit culture and traditional knowledge, often referred to in English as "IQ") into the territory's political and governmental decisions.
[
100
]
Due to the territory's small population, and the fact that there are only a few hundred voters in each electoral district, the possibility of two election candidates finishing in an exact tie is significantly higher than in any Canadian province. This has actually happened twice in the five elections to date, with exact ties in
Akulliq
in the
2008 Nunavut general election
and in
Rankin Inlet South
in the
2013 Nunavut general election
. In such an event, Nunavut's practice is to schedule a follow-up
by-election
rather than choosing the winning candidate by an arbitrary method. The territory has also had numerous instances where MLAs were directly
acclaimed
to office as the only person to register their candidacy by the deadline, as well as one instance where a follow-up by-election had to be held due to no candidates registering for the regular election in their district at all.
Owing to Nunavut's vast size, the stated goal of the territorial government has been to decentralize governance beyond the region's capital. Three
regions
—
Kitikmeot
,
Kivalliq
and
Qikiqtaaluk (formerly Baffin)
—are the basis for more localized administration, although they lack autonomous governments of their own.

Nunavut was licensed by the NWT to use the same
licence plate
design in 1999 when it became a separate territory,
[

Alcohol and tobacco
[
edit
]
Due to prohibition laws influenced by local and traditional beliefs, Nunavut has a highly regulated alcohol market. The territory is the last outpost of prohibition in Canada, and it is often easier to obtain firearms than alcohol. Alcohol remains prohibited in six communities across the territory: Arivat, Coral Harbour, Goja Haven, Kugaaruk, Pangnirtung and Sanikiluaq.
[
108
]
Although every community in Nunavut has slightly differing regulations, as a whole it is still very restrictive. Seven communities have complete bans against alcohol and another 14 have orders being restricted by local committees. Due to these laws, a lucrative bootlegging market has appeared in which people mark up the prices of bottles by extraordinary amounts.
[
109
]
The RCMP estimate Nunavut's bootleg liquor market rakes in some $10 million a year.
[
108
]
Despite the restrictions, alcohol's availability leads to widespread alcohol-related crime. One estimation states some 95% of police calls are alcohol-related.
[
110
]
Alcohol is also believed to be a contributing factor to the territory's high rates of violence, suicide, and homicide. A special task force created in 2010 to study and address the territory's increasing alcohol-related problems recommended the government ease alcohol restrictions. With prohibition shown to be highly ineffective historically, some believe these laws contribute to the territory's widespread social ills. Others are skeptical about the effectiveness of liquor sale liberalization and want to ban it completely. In 2014, Nunavut's government moved toward more legalization. In 2017, the first liquor store in 38 years opened in Iqaluit.
[
108
]
Nunavut has the highest
smoking
rate in all of Canada. More than half of its adult population smoke cigarettes,
[
111

with both men and women smoking regularly. Some 90% of pregnant women are smokers, although studies have shown it has detrimental effects.
