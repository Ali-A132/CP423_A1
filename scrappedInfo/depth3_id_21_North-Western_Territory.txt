The
North-Western Territory
was a region of
British North America
extant until 1870 and named for where it lay in relation to
Rupert's Land
.
Because of the lack of development, exploration, and
cartographic
limits of the time, the exact boundaries, ownership, and administration of the region were not precisely defined when the territory was extant. There is also not a definitive date when the British first asserted sovereignty over the territory. Maps vary in defining the boundaries of the territory; however, in modern usage, the region is generally accepted to be the region bounded by modern-day
British Columbia
, the
continental divide
with
Rupert's Land
,
Russian America
(later
Alaska
), and the
Arctic Ocean
. The territory covered what is now the
Yukon
, mainland
Northwest Territories
, northwestern mainland
Nunavut
, northwestern
Saskatchewan
, and northern
Alberta
.
The North-Western Territory was not technically within the area of land granted to the Hudson's Bay Company in May 1670, as the region did not drain into Hudson's Bay.

However, the
Hudson's Bay Company
(HBC) was still the de facto administrator of the region and the territory was included in the same
process of transferring Rupert's Land
to
Canada
from the HBC, effective on July 15, 1870.
History

See also:
History of the Northwest Territories
It is obscure when exactly
Great Britain
first asserted sovereignty over the territory; however, after France accepted British sovereignty over the
Hudson Bay
coast by the
Treaty of Utrecht (1713)
, Britain was the only European power with practical access to that part of the continent. The
Hudson's Bay Company
, despite the royal charter assigning only
Rupert's Land
to the company, had long used the region as part of its trading area.
The North West Company
also hunted and trapped on the land and this led to frequent conflicts between the companies.

To ease tensions, the British government assigned administrative duties to the HBC, while still allowing The North West Company to hunt on the lands with the passage of "An act for regulating the fur trade, and establishing a criminal and civil jurisdiction within certain parts of North America", in 1821.

As well, large areas of Rupert's Land were not accurately mapped then to know the precise boundaries. The British made almost no effort to assert sovereignty over the
aboriginal peoples
of the area. In accordance with the
Royal Proclamation of 1763
, large-scale settlement by non-aboriginal people was prohibited until the lands were surrendered by
treaty
.

Canada provinces 1870–1871, showing the succeeding divisions of the North-Western Territory. The
Northwest Territories
is stylized as the North-West Territories during this period.
In 1862 during the
Stikine Gold Rush
, part of the North-Western Territory became the
Stickeen (Stikine) Territory
when the Stikine became inundated by American miners and, to prevent any resulting American claims to or agitation for the region,
Governor James Douglas
of the
Vancouver Island
and
British Columbia
colonies declared the area a British territory. The coastal area at the mouth of the Stikine was part of
Russian America
at the time, but the British had rights of free navigation to the Stikine by treaties in 1825 and 1839 as well as a lease of coastal lands to the south of it. The boundary of the North-Western Territory in this region, and likewise the Stickeen Territories created from it, south of and northwards from the Stikine, had been set as "ten marine leagues" from the sea, but this remained undefined until the
Alaska Boundary Settlement
of 1903.  The North-Western Territory's boundary with Russian America north of the 60th Parallel had been set at the 141st line of longitude by the
Treaty of St. Petersburg in 1825
.
The year following the creation of the Stickeen Territories, part of the Stikine returned to the North-Western Territory when boundaries were adjusted and the Colony of British Columbia was extended to the
60th parallel north
, a measure which also brought into British Columbia its portion of the
Peace River Block
, which had not been part of the Stikine Territory. In 1868, shortly after
Canadian Confederation
, the Hudson's Bay Company agreed to surrender its vast territories to the new
dominion
. However, it was not until July 15, 1870, that the transfer to
Canada
was made.
On that date the North-Western Territory became part of the newly created
Northwest Territories
(often stylized as the North-West Territories).
In 1880, the
British Arctic Territories
were claimed by Canada and later formed the Northwest Territories and
Nunavut
.
In 1898 the
Yukon Territory
was formed when the areas west of the
Mackenzie Mountains
were removed from the Northwest Territories during the
Klondike Gold Rush
, again as with the Stickeen Territory to prevent efforts at American takeover and also to enable easier governance.

was formed in 1876, and lasted until
1888
. The 2nd Council lasted to
