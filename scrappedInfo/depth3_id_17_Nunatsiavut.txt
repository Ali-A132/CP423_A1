) is an
autonomous area
claimed by the
Inuit
in
Newfoundland and Labrador
, Canada. The settlement area includes territory in
Labrador
extending to the
Quebec
border. In 2002, the Labrador Inuit Association submitted a proposal for limited autonomy to the
government of Newfoundland and Labrador
. The constitution was ratified on December 1, 2005, at which time the Labrador Inuit Association ceased to exist, and the new Government of Nunatsiavut was established, initially being responsible for health, education and cultural affairs. It is also responsible for setting and conducting elections, the first of which was executed in October 2006. An election for the ordinary members of the
Nunatsiavut Assembly
was held on May 4, 2010.
[

]
Its incumbent president is
Johannes Lampe
who assumed office in 2016.
In
Inuttitut
/
Inuktitut
, Nunatsiavut means "Our Beautiful Land". This name was ratified by the Labrador Inuit Constitution and passed by the Labrador Inuit Association in 2002. A primary objective of autonomy is for the preservation of the
Inuit culture
and
language
, as well as the environment through environmental stewardship.
Nunatsiavut is counted in the census as Division 11.
Self-governance
[
edit
]
The Labrador Inuit Association had filed a
land claim
for portions of Labradorian land in 1977.
[
3
]
In 1988, the Labrador Inuit Association, the government of the province of Newfoundland, and the
government of Canada
began negotiations based on the land claim.
[
4
]
An agreement-in-principle was achieved in 2001, and on May 26, 2004, the agreement was ratified by over 75% of eligible voters subject to the land claim.
[
4
]
On January 22, 2005, the Inuit of Nunatsiavut signed the Labrador Inuit Lands Claims Agreement
[
5
]
with the federal and provincial governments covering 72,520 km
2
(28,000 sq mi) of land,
[
3
]
including the entire northern salient of Labrador north of
Nain
as well as a portion of the Atlantic coast south of there. The agreement also includes 44,030 km
2
(17,000 sq mi) of sea rights.
[
3
]
Although the Inuit will not own the whole area, they were granted special rights related to traditional land use, and they will own 15,800 km
2
(6,100 sq mi) designated Labrador Inuit Lands.
[
3
]
The agreement also establishes the
Torngat Mountains National Park
in the northern area of the land claim.
The Labrador Inuit Lands Claims Agreement is a treaty between the Inuit of Labrador, the provincial government of Newfoundland and Labrador, and the federal government of Canada, that is constitutionally protected under the aboriginal and treaty rights of
Indigenous peoples in Canada
granted by
section 35
of the
Constitution Act, 1982
.
[
5
]
The self-governance agreement included a transfer of $130 million from the federal government in compensation for the forced relocation of the Inuit in the 1950s;
[
6
]
$120 million to establish self-government; royalty payments from the provincial government for resource extraction; and land, mineral, and marine rights.
[
7
]
Unspecified benefits for Inuit in Labrador not within the settlement area were also part of the agreement.
[
3
]
The agreement was ratified by the Labrador Inuit, the
General Assembly of Newfoundland and Labrador
, and the
Parliament of Canada
, where it received
Royal Assent
on June 23, 2005.
[
8
]
On December 1, 2005, the constitution was formally adopted, and a swearing-in ceremony was held for the first cabinet,
[
9
]
an interim government which consisted of members of the Labrador Inuit Association board of directors.
[
9
]
This day marked the official transfer of power from the provincial government to the newly formed Government of Nunatsiavut "to make their own laws relating to cultural affairs, education and health".
[
10
]
In October 2006, Nunatsiavut held its first election to form a nine-member government, which was sworn in on October 16 in
Hopedale
.
[
11
]
In 2019, there were 150 Inuit children in the care of the
Department of Children, Seniors, and Social Development
. An independent review,
A Long Wait for Change
, was completed by the province's Child and Youth Advocate at the request of the Nunatsiavut government and released in 2019. It contained 33 recommendations, including providing the support needed to transition to an Inuit-led child welfare system in Nunatsiavut.
[
12
]
On June 18, 2021, Nunatsiavut stated that it had begun the process of seeking
devolution
of child protection services from the Department of Children, Seniors, and Social Development with the goal for negotiations to conclude within three years.

Nunatsiavut Assembly and Executive Council
[
edit
]
Nunatsiavut Assembly Building
The land claim agreement provided for the establishment of the Government of Nunatsiavut to represent the residents of the land claim area and any Labrador Inuit living elsewhere in Canada. Nunatsiavut remained a part of Newfoundland and Labrador, but the Government of Nunatsiavut acquired the jurisdictional authority over health, education, and justice in the land claim area. Nunatsiavut operates under a
consensus government
within the parliamentary system of Canada.
The legislature of the government is based in Hopedale, and its administrative centre is in
Nain
. It is subject to the
Nunatsiavut Elections Act
. The
Nunatsiavut Assembly
consists of a minimum of 16 members, including:
a president, who chairs the Nunatsiavut Executive Council,
[
16
]
ten ordinary members
[
16
]
(one each from
Hopedale
,
Makkovik
,
Postville
and
Rigolet
;
[
17
]
two each from
Nain
, the
Happy Valley-Goose Bay
,
Northwest River
and Mud Lake area, and all Inuit elsewhere in Canada)
the
Angajukĸâk
(mayor) of each of the five Inuit Community Governments (one each in Nain, Hopedale, Postville, Makkovik and Rigolet)
the Chairs of the Inuit Community Corporations.
[
16
]
There are currently two Inuit Community Corporations,
NunaKatiget Inuit Community Corporation
and
Sivunivut Inuit Community Corporation
,
[
18
]
and 18 members in the Assembly.
From the Assembly, a member will be elected to act as First Minister. The Assembly would act as a forum for discussion of laws, and it will oversee the Executive Council.
The Nunatsiavut Executive Council will be appointed by the First Minister. It will implement laws, develop and implement policy, initiate and prepare legislation, oversee the administration of the government, and be accountable to the Assembly.
Inuit Community Governments were established in Nain, Hopedale, Makkovik, Postville and Rigolet. Each consists of a municipal council, elected from and by both Inuit and non-Inuit residents, and is led by an
Angajukĸâk
, a chief executive officer and mayor, who must be Inuk.
Large settlements of Labrador Inuit outside the settlement area will be represented by Inuit Community Corporations.
The Angajukĸâk of each Inuit Community Government and the chairperson of each Inuit Community Corporation will represent his or her community in the Nunatsiavut Assembly.

Nunatsiavut Government Head Office is located at 25 Ikajuktauvik Road in
Nain
and houses the administrative functions of the Government of Nunatsiavut.
The
Nunatsiavut Assembly
sits at
Nunatsiavut Assembly Building
in
Hopedale
. The building opened in 2012, faces Hopedale Harbour
[
21
]
and is the first permanent home since 2008 (previous assemblies met at various locations in Hopedale).
Geography
[
edit
]
Saglek Fjord, Torngat Mountains National Park
Nunatsiavut's land claim includes the area surrounding
Hamilton Inlet

; the Mulligan River also forms part of the boundary. It also claims the land north of the Notakwanon River and as far north as
Cape Chidley
. Nunatsiavut is the southernmost recognized Inuit territory in Canada.
Nunatsiavut's territory consists of two geographic regions. The southern portion contains Rigolet, Makkovik, Postville and Hopedale and has a population of 1,433 (as of 2016).
[

Land disputes
[
edit

The Labrador Métis Nation (LMN), unsuccessfully filed a challenge to Nunatsiavut's claim in the
Supreme Court of Newfoundland and Labrador
. The LMN's original land claim included all of Labrador south of Nain.
[
23
]
The
Makivik Corporation
had their claim to the coast between
Killiniq Island
and
Voisey's Bay
accepted in 1993; it later asked the federal government not to ratify Nunatsiavut's claims since it overlapped with their claim.

Kablunângajuit
[
edit
]
According to the Nunatsiavut government,
[
31
]
somebody who is a Kablunângajuk (plural: Kablunângajuit) is "an individual who is given that designation according to
Inuit customs and traditions". The Nunatsiavut government applies this designation to somebody who is either of mixed Inuit and non-Inuit descent or is not of Inuit descent but settled in what is now Nunatsiavut before 1940. Their ancestors were mainly
fur traders
from places such as Quebec, Scotland, Norway and elsewhere who often married Inuit.
[
32
]
The term Kablunângajuk means "person who resembles a white person". They were historically called terms such as "settlers" or "
half-breeds
".
[
28
]
The Kablunângajuit are usually counted as Inuit by
Statistics Canada
so their exact population is unknown. As Nunatsiavut beneficiaries, they have all the same privileges as Inuit beneficiaries in the region.
Employment
[
edit
]
In the 2016 census, 29.9% of Nunatsiavut's population was unemployed.
[
