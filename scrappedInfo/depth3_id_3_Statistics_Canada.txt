Statistics Canada
(
StatCan
;
French
:
Statistique Canada
), formed in 1971, is the agency of the
Government of Canada
commissioned with producing statistics to help better understand Canada, its population, resources, economy, society, and culture. It is headquartered in
Ottawa
.
[

The agency is led by the
chief statistician of Canada
, currently

, who assumed the role on an interim basis on April 1, 2024
[

]
and permanently on December 20, 2024.
[

]
StatCan is accountable to Parliament through the
minister of Innovation, Science and Industry
, currently
Mélanie Joly
.
Statistics Canada acts as the national statistical agency for Canada, and Statistics Canada produces statistics for all the
provinces
as well as the federal government. In addition to conducting about 350 active
surveys
on virtually all aspects of Canadian life, the
Statistics Act
mandates that Statistics Canada has a duty to conduct a country-wide
census
of population every five years and a
census of agriculture
every ten years.
[

It has regularly been considered the best statistical organization in the world by
The Economist
,
[

]
such as in the 1991
[

]
and 1993
[

"Good Statistics" surveys. The
Public Policy Forum
and others have also recognized successes of the agency.

, and social and justice conditions. It also publishes a
peer-reviewed
statistics journal

History
[
edit
]
Statistics Canada was formed by the Statistics Act,
[
21
]
which came into force on May 1, 1971.
[
22
]
It replaced the
Dominion Bureau of Statistics
,
[
23
]
which was formed in 1918. Statistics Canada published a print copy of the yearly almanac entitled
Canada Year Book
from 1967 to 2012
[
24
]
when it ceased publication due to ebbing demand and deep budgetary cutbacks to StatCan by the federal government.
[
24
]
It was a yearly compendium of statistical lore and information on the nation's social and economic past, people, events and facts.
[
25
]
The
Canada Year Book
was originally edited by a volunteer from the
Department of Finance
and published by a private company, which offset costs with advertisement sales.  This method continued until 1879, at which time the record ceases, until 1885, at which time the
Department of Agriculture
took up the burden. The duty of publication was transferred to the Dominion Bureau of Statistics upon its formation in 1918.
On June 18, 2005, after years of study by expert panels, discussion, debate (privacy vs the interests of genealogists and historians), Bill S-18
An Act to Amend the Statistics Act
was passed which released personal census records for censuses taken between 1911 and 2001, inclusive.
[
26
]
Debate over the census and their contents had periodically created changes in the
Statistics Act
such as a
2005 amendment
making the privacy restrictions of the census information expire after more than a century. In addition, with Bill S-18, starting with the 2006 census, Canadians can consent to the public release of their personal census information after 92 years. Census returns are in the custody of Statistics Canada and the records are closed until 92 years after the taking of a census, when those records may be opened for public use and transferred to
Library and Archives Canada
subject to individual consent where applicable.
[
27
]
The mandatory long census form was cancelled by the federal government in 2010 in favour of a voluntary household survey (NHS).
[
28
]
The mandatory long form census was reinstated in time for the 2016 census of population.
In 2011, Statistics Canada released an audit acknowledging that from 2004 to 2011, their automated computer processes had "inadvertently made economic data available to data distributors before the official publication time." In November 2011, in response to the audit, StatCan stopped that process.
[
29
]
2012 layoffs
[
edit
]
Nearly half of Statistics Canada's 5000 employees were notified in April 2012 that their jobs might be eliminated as part of
austerity
measures imposed by the Conservative federal government in the
2012 Canadian federal budget
.
[
30
]
The 2,300 employees underwent a process to determine which ones were not impacted, which were eliminated and which were given early retirement or put in new positions.
[
31
]
These budget cuts reduced the amount of information Statistics Canada was able to produce during that time period.
[
30
]
The census
[
edit
]
By law, every household must complete the
Canada census
form.
[
32
]
In
May 2006
, an Internet version of the census was made widely available for the first time. Another census was held in
May 2011
, again with the internet being the primary method for statistical data collection. The
most recent census
was held in May 2021, with the resulting data expected to be published in seven separate data sets throughout 2022.
[
33
]
Additional data will be published at a future date which has yet to be determined.
2011 voluntary long form or National Household Survey
[
edit
]
Main article:
Canada 2011 census
On June 17, 2010 an
Order in Council
was created by Minister of Industry
Tony Clement
defining the questions for the 2011 census as including only the short-form questions; this was published in the
Canada Gazette
on June 26, 2010,
[
34
]
however a news release was not issued by Minister Clement until July 13, 2010. This release stated in part "The government will retain the mandatory short form that will collect basic demographic information. To meet the need for additional information, and to respect the privacy wishes of Canadians, the government has introduced the voluntary National Household Survey".
[
35
]
On July 30, 2010 Statistics Canada published a description of the National Household Survey.
[
36
]
Minister Clement initially indicated that these changes were being made based on consultations with Statistics Canada
[
37
]
but was forced to admit that the change from a mandatory to voluntary form was not one of the recommendations received from StatsCan after the head of the agency
Munir Sheikh
resigned in protest.
[
38
]
Information was uncovered that indicated attempts on the part of the government to distance themselves from the decision, instructing Statistics Canada officials to delete the phrase "as per government decision" from documents which were being written to inform Statistics Canada staff of the change.
[
39
]
Minister Clement had claimed that concerns over privacy
[
40
]
and the threat of jail time
[
41
]
were the reasons for the change
[
42
]
and had refused to reverse his decision
[
43
]
stating that the prime minister supported the legislation.
[
44
]
The argument over privacy was subsequently undermined by a
privacy commissioner
statement that she was "satisfied with the measures Statistics Canada had put into place to protect privacy".
[
45
]
Other industry professionals also came out in defence of Statistics Canada's record on privacy issues.
[
46
]
[
47
]
The government maintained its position, with Lynn Meahan, press secretary to the
Minister of Industry
, stating that the new census would result in "useable (sic) and useful data that can meet the needs of many users."
[
48
]
During the 2010 debates, the
Freedom Party of Ontario
(FPO), a small group based on
Ayn Rand
's writings, whose 42 candidates received 12,381 votes (or 0.26% of the popular vote) in the 2014 election, opposed the long census. They also opposed
bilingualism
,
political correctness
and the inclusion of a question on race on the
1996 Canadian census
. FPO claimed that Canadian and British traditions had been dishonoured by
multiculturalism
. They were among a minority who argued that using statistical data to analyse resource allocation is not beneficial.
[
46
]
[
49
]
[
50
]
Central to the debate on this issue was the effect on the quality of data which would be collected by Statistics Canada under the new system. Many groups made the claim that a voluntary system would not provide a quality of data consistent with what Statistics Canada is known for
[
38
]
[
43
]
[
46
]
[
47
]
while others felt that politically motivated changes to StatsCan methodology tainted the reputation of the whole organization in the international setting.
[
51
]
Supporters of the change offered models of European countries who were adopting alternate systems,
[
40
]
although in these states the census was being replaced with a database of information on each citizen rather than a voluntary poll and none of these systems were planned for the Canadian 2011 census. They also challenged the existing system's ability to cope with rapid socio-demographic changes, though this would not be addressed without increasing the frequency of the survey. Some public opposition to the changes were expressed on
Facebook
.
[
52
]
According to
The Globe and Mail
, by 2015 an increasing number of economists had joined with organizations such as the Canadian Chamber of Commerce,
Canadian Federation of Independent Business
,
Canadian Economics Association
,
Martin Prosperity Institute
,
Toronto Region Board of Trade
, Restaurants Canada and the Canadian Association of Business Economics to call for a reinstatement of the mandatory long form.
[
28
]
Edmonton's chief economist had preferred the long form and argued that the National Housing Survey was only useful at the aggregate city level and left "a dearth of data on long-term changes at the neighbourhood level and within demographic groups... making it difficult to make decisions such as 'where to build a library, where to build a fire hall' without specific demographic information,"
[
28
]
and that because it was not mandatory, there was a lower response rate and therefore increased risk of under-representation of some vulnerable segments of society, for example aboriginal peoples and newly arrived immigrants, which made it more difficult to "pinpoint trends such as income inequality, immigrant outcomes in the jobs market, labour shortages and demographic shifts."
[
28
]
2015 reinstatement of mandatory long form
[
edit
]
One day after his election in November 2015, the Liberal government of
Justin Trudeau
reinstated the mandatory census long form
[
53
]
and it was used in the 2016 census.
[
54
]
[
55
]
Political reactions
[
edit
]
Former industry minister Tony Clement recanted on his support for the elimination of the long form. He avowed that there were ways to protect both indispensable data and Canadians' privacy. Blaming his party for a "collective" decision to terminate the long form, he said, "I think I would have done it differently." He implied incorrectly that Statistics Canada head Munir Sheikh had agreed with the cancellation when it was done.
