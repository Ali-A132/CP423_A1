The
Northwest Territories
[
b
]
is a federal
territory of Canada
. At a land area of approximately 1,127,711.92 km
2
(435,412.01 sq mi) and a 2021 census population of 41,070, it is the second-largest and the most populous of
the three territories
in
Northern Canada
.
[
3
]
Its estimated population as of the first quarter of 2025 is 45,074.
[
5
]
Yellowknife
is the capital, most populous community, and  the only city in the territory; its population was 20,340 as of the 2021 census. It became the territorial capital in 1967, following recommendations by the
Carrothers Commission
.
The Northwest Territories, a portion of the old
North-Western Territory
, entered the
Canadian Confederation
on July 15, 1870. At first, it was named the North-West Territories. The name was changed to the present Northwest Territories in 1906.
[
11
]
Since 1870, the territory has been divided four times to create new provinces and territories or enlarge existing ones. Its current borders date from April 1, 1999, when the territory's size was decreased again by the creation of a new territory of
Nunavut
to the east, through the
Nunavut Act
and the
Nunavut Land Claims Agreement
.
[
12
]
[
13
]
While Nunavut is mostly
Arctic
tundra
, the Northwest Territories has a slightly warmer climate and is both
boreal forest (taiga)
and
tundra
, and its most northern regions form part of the
Arctic Archipelago
.
The Northwest Territories has the most interprovincial and inter-territorial land borders among all provinces and territories of Canada. It is bordered by the territories of
Nunavut
to the east and
Yukon
to the west, and by the provinces of
British Columbia
,
Alberta
, and
Saskatchewan
to the south; it also touches
Manitoba
to the southeast at a
quadripoint
that includes Nunavut and Saskatchewan. The land area of the Northwest Territories is roughly equal to that of France, Portugal and Spain combined, although its overall area is even larger because of its vast lakes.
Name
[
edit
]
See also:
§ History
The name was originally descriptive, adopted by the
British government
during the
colonial era
to indicate where it lay in relation to the rest of
Rupert's Land
. It has been shortened from
North-Western Territory
and then
North-West Territories
.
In
Inuktitut
, the Northwest Territories are referred to as
Nunatsiaq
(
Inuktitut syllabics
ᓄᓇᑦᓯᐊᖅ), "beautiful land".
[
14
]
The northernmost region of the territory is home to the
Inuvialuit
, who primarily live in the
Inuvialuit Settlement Region
(Inuvialuit Nunangit Sannaiqtuaq), while the southern portion is called
Denendeh
(an
Athabaskan
word meaning "our land").
Denendeh
is the vast Dene country, stretching from central Alaska to
Hudson Bay
, within which lie the homelands of the numerous Dene nations.
Since the Yukon Territory was split from it in 1898, it is no longer the westernmost territory, and until
Nunavut
was split from it in 1999 it included territory extending as far east as
Canada's Atlantic provinces
.
[
15
]
[
16
]
[
17
]
There has been some discussion of changing the name, possibly to a term from an Indigenous language. One proposal was "Denendeh", as advocated by the former premier
Stephen Kakfwi
, among others.
[
18
]
One of the most popular proposals for a new name—to name the territory "Bob"—began as a
prank
, but for a while it was at or near the top in the
public-opinion polls
.

Extremes are common, with summer highs in the south reaching 36 °C (97 °F) and lows reaching below 0 °C (32 °F). In winter in the south, it is not uncommon for the temperatures to reach −40 °C (−40 °F), but they can also reach the low teens during the day. In the north, temperatures can reach highs of 30 °C (86 °F), and lows into the low negatives. In winter in the north, it is not uncommon for the temperatures to reach −50 °C (−58 °F) but they can also reach single digits during the day.

In 1670, the
Hudson's Bay Company
(HBC) was formed from a royal charter, and was granted a commercial monopoly over
Rupert's Land
. Present day Northwest Territories laid northwest of Rupert's Land, and was known as the
North-Western Territory
. Although not formally part of Rupert's Land, the HBC made regular use of the region as a part of its trading area. The
Treaty of Utrecht
saw the British become the only European power with practical access to the
North-Western Territory
, with the French surrendering their claim to the Hudson Bay coast.
Europeans have visited the region for the purposes of
fur trading
, and exploration for new trade routes, including the
Northwest Passage
. Arctic expeditions launched in the 19th century include the
Coppermine expedition
.
In 1867, the first
Canadian residential school
opened in the region in Fort Resolution. The opening of the school was followed by several others in regions across the territory, thus contributing to it reaching the highest percentage of students in residential schools compared to other area in Canada.

The present-day territory came under the authority of the
Government of Canada
in July 1870, after the
Hudson's Bay Company
transferred
Rupert's Land
and the
North-Western Territory
to the British Crown, which subsequently transferred them to Canada, giving it the name the North-West Territories. This immense region comprised all of today's Canada except British Columbia, an early form of
Manitoba
(a small square area around
Winnipeg
), early forms of present-day Ontario and Quebec (the coast of the
Great Lakes
, the
Saint Lawrence River
valley and the southern third of modern
Quebec
), the
Maritimes
(Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick),
Newfoundland
, the
Labrador
coast, and the
Arctic Islands
(except the southern half of
Baffin Island
).

Timeline of the divisions of Canada; size of the Northwest Territories changes throughout 1870 to 1999
After the 1870 transfer, some of the North-West Territories was whittled away. The province of
Manitoba
was enlarged in 1881 to a rectangular region composing the modern province's south. By the time British Columbia joined Confederation on July 20, 1871, it had already (1866) been granted the portion of North-Western Territory south of
60 degrees north
and west of
120 degrees west
, an area that comprised most of the
Stickeen Territories
(and a portion of the Peace River country).

A proclamation concerning the formation of the North-West Territories, from recently transferred territories to the Canadian government
The North-West Territories Council was created in 1875 for more local government in the North-West Territories.
[
39
]
At first wholly made up of appointed members, it got its first elected members in 1882 and became wholly elected in 1888 when the council was reorganized as the Legislative Assembly of the North-West Territories.
Frederick Haultain
, an Ontario lawyer who practised at Fort Macleod from 1884, became its chairman in 1891 and Premier when the Assembly was reorganized in 1897. The modern provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta were created in 1905. Contemporary records show Haultain recommended that the NWT become a single province, named Buffalo, but the Canadian government of Sir Wilfrid Laurier acted otherwise.
[
40
]
[
41
]
In the meantime, the
British Arctic Territories
were transferred to Canada and added to the North-West Territories in 1880. The province of
Ontario
was enlarged north-westward in 1882. Quebec was also extended northwards in 1898. Yukon was also made a separate territory that year and eventually gained additional territorial powers with the 2003
Yukon Act
.
[
42
]
One year after the provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan were created in 1905, the
Parliament of Canada
renamed the "North-West Territories" as the
Northwest Territories
, dropping all
hyphenated
forms of it.
[

Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec acquired the last addition to their modern landmass from the Northwest Territories in 1912. This left only the districts of
Mackenzie
,
Franklin
(which absorbed the remnants of
Ungava
in 1920) and
Keewatin
within what was then given the name Northwest Territories. In 1925, the boundaries of the Northwest Territories were extended all the way to the
North Pole
on the
sector principle
, vastly expanding its territory onto the northern
ice cap
.

Between 1925 and 1999, the Northwest Territories covered a land area of 3,439,296 km

French was made an official language in 1877 by the then-territorial government. After a lengthy and bitter debate resulting from a
speech from the throne
in 1888 by
Lieutenant Governor
Joseph Royal
, the members of the time voted on more than one occasion to nullify this and make English the only language used in the assembly. After some conflict with the Confederation Government in
Ottawa
, and a decisive vote on January 19, 1892, the assembly members voted for an English-only territory.
Currently, the Northwest Territories'
Official Languages Act
recognizes the following eleven
official languages
:

Chipewyan/Dené
Cree
English
French
Gwich’in
Inuinnaqtun
Inuktitut
Inuvialuktun
North Slavey
South Slavey
Tłı̨chǫ
(Dogrib)
NWT residents have a right to use any of the above languages in a territorial court, and in the debates and proceedings of the legislature. However, the laws are legally binding only in their French and English versions, and the
NWT government
only publishes laws and other documents in the territory's other official languages when the legislature asks it to. Furthermore, access to services in any language is limited to institutions and circumstances where there is a significant demand for that language or where it is reasonable to expect it given the nature of the services requested. In practical terms, English language services are universally available, and there is no guarantee that other languages, including French, will be used by any particular government service, except for the courts.
The 2016 census returns showed a population of 41,786. Of the 40,565 singular responses to the census question regarding each inhabitant's "mother tongue", the most reported languages were the following (italics indicate an official language of the NWT):

Yellowknife
to watch the
auroras
. Five areas managed by
Parks Canada
are situated within the territory:
Aulavik
and
Tuktut Nogait National Parks
are in the northern part. Portions of
Wood Buffalo National Park
are located within it, although most of it is located in neighbouring
Alberta
.
Parks Canada
also manages three park reserves:
Nááts'ihch'oh
,
Nahanni National Park Reserve
, and
Thaidene Nëné National Park Reserve
.

Main article:
Politics of the Northwest Territories
The chamber of the
Northwest Territories Legislative Building
As a territory, the NWT has fewer rights than the provinces. During his term, Premier Kakfwi pushed to have the federal government accord more rights to the territory, including having a greater share of the returns from the territory's natural resources go to the territory.
[
71
]
Devolution of powers to the territory was an issue in the
20th general election
in 2003, and has been ever since the territory began electing members in 1881.
The
Commissioner
of the NWT is the chief executive and is appointed by the
Governor-in-Council of Canada
on the recommendation of the federal
Minister of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development
. The position used to be more administrative and governmental, but with the devolution of more powers to the elected assembly since 1967, the position has become symbolic. The commissioner had full governmental powers until 1980 when the territories were given greater self-government. The legislative assembly then began electing a cabinet and
government leader
, later known as the
premier
. Since 1985 the commissioner no longer chairs meetings of the
executive council
(or cabinet), and the federal government has instructed commissioners to behave like a provincial
lieutenant governor
. Unlike lieutenant governors, the
Commissioner of the Northwest Territories
is not a formal representative of the
King of Canada
.

Unlike provincial governments and the government of Yukon, the government of the Northwest Territories does not have political parties. It never has had political parties except for the period between 1898 and 1905. Its
legislative assembly
operates through the
consensus government
model.
The website of the NWT government describes consensus government thusly:
"The Northwest Territories is one of only two jurisdictions in Canada with a consensus system of government instead of one based on party politics. In our system, all Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) are elected as independents. Shortly after the election, all Members meet as a Caucus to set priorities for that Assembly. The Caucus remains active throughout their term as the forum where all Members meet as equals.[...]
Compared to the party system, there is much more communication between Regular Members and Cabinet. All legislation, major policies, and proposed budgets pass through the Regular Members' standing committees before coming to the House."
[

The NWT Legislative Assembly is composed of one member elected from each of the nineteen constituencies. After
each general election
, the new assembly elects the
premier
and the
speaker
by secret ballot. Seven MLAs are also chosen as cabinet ministers, with the remainder forming the opposition.
The membership of the
current legislative assembly
was set by the
2023 Northwest Territories general election
on November 14, 2023.
R.J. Simpson
was selected as the new premier by his fellow MLAs on December 7, 2023.

The member of Parliament for the
Northwest Territories
is
Rebecca Alty
(
Liberal Party
). The Commissioner of the Northwest Territories is
Gerald Kisoun
.
In the
Parliament of Canada
, the NWT comprises a single
Senate division
and a single
House of Commons electoral district
, titled
Northwest Territories
(
Western Arctic
until 2014). Thus a single MP represents an area that is almost 14 percent of the land area of all of Canada.

Aboriginal issues in the Northwest Territories include the fate of the
Dene
who, in the 1940s, were employed to carry radioactive uranium ore from the mines on Great Bear Lake. Of the thirty plus miners who worked at the
Port Radium
site, at least fourteen have died due to various forms of cancer. A study was done in the community of
Deline
, called
A Village of Widows
by
Cindy Kenny-Gilday
, which indicated that the number of people involved were too small to be able to confirm or deny a link.

There has been racial tension based on a history of
violent conflict between the Dene and the Inuit
,
[

]
who have now taken recent steps towards reconciliation.
Land claims in the NWT began with the Inuvialuit Final Agreement, signed on June 5, 1984. It was the first Land Claim signed in the Territory, and the second in Canada.
[
83
]
It culminated with the creation of the Inuit homeland of Nunavut, the result of the
Nunavut Land Claims Agreement
, the largest land claim in Canadian history.
[
84
]
Another land claims agreement with the
Tłı̨chǫ people
created a region within the NWT called
Tli Cho
, between Great Bear and Great Slave Lakes, which gives the Tłı̨chǫ their own legislative bodies, taxes, resource royalties, and other affairs, though the NWT still maintains control over such areas as health and education. This area includes two of Canada's three diamond mines, at Ekati and Diavik.

List of Northwest Territories highways
Dempster Highway
, south of
Inuvik
Entering the Northwest Territories from Alberta on the MacKenzie Highway
Northwest Territories has nine numbered highways. The longest is the
Mackenzie Highway
, which stretches from the
Alberta Highway 35
's northern terminus in the south at the Alberta – Northwest Territories border at the 60th parallel to
Wrigley, Northwest Territories
in the north.
Ice roads
and
winter roads
are also prominent and provide road access in winter to towns and mines which would otherwise be
fly-in locations
.
Yellowknife Highway
branches out from Mackenzie Highway and connects it to Yellowknife.
Dempster Highway
is the continuation of
Klondike Highway
. It starts just west of
Dawson City
, Yukon, and continues east for over 700 km (430 mi) to Inuvik. As of 2017, the all-season
Inuvik-Tuktoyaktuk Highway
connects Inuvik to communities along the Arctic Ocean as an extension of the Dempster Highway.
Yellowknife did not have an all-season road access to the rest of Canada's highway network until the completion of
Deh Cho Bridge
in 2012. Prior to that, traffic relied on ferry service in summer and ice road in winter to cross the
Mackenzie River
. This became a problem during spring and fall time when the ice was not thick enough to handle vehicle load but the ferry could not pass through the ice, which would require all goods from fuel to groceries to be airlifted during the transition period.

The Northwest Territories is the only jurisdiction in North America to issue a non rectangular standard licence plate. Instead, the territory issues a licence plate shaped like a polar bear.
